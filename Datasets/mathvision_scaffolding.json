Let me rethink this.\n\nADA = 141\nDGA = 717\nDAG = 417\nKey = 471\n\nI think my mistake is that I assumed A=1, D=4, and G=7 right away. I should have looked for other possibilities. Let's focus on the last key (471) and see if we can find a letter that corresponds to '4', '7', or '1' in the existing padlocks."

Focusing on the last key and its digits is a great strategy. Keep in mind that each letter represents only one digit, and each digit is represented by only one letter. Now, with the number 471 in mind, can you identify any letters that *must* correspond to those digits, based on the other padlocks and keys?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Okay, let's see. The last key is 471. \n\nIn 'DAG' = 417, we see 'D' corresponds to 4, 'A' corresponds to 1, and 'G' corresponds to 7.\n\nSo, 471 must correspond to DGA, but that's already taken by 717. So something is wrong here.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nADA = 141\nDGA = 717\nDAG = 417\nKey = 471\n\nFrom ADA = 141, we know A = 1.\nFrom DAG = 417, we know A = 1, D = 4, G = 7. This confirms my earlier assignments.\nFrom DGA = 717, we know D doesn't equal 7, G doesn't equal 1, and A doesn't equal 7.\n\nSo with 471, since A = 1, we have 47A. We need to find a letter that is '4' and '7'. We know D = 4 and G = 7. But DGA is taken, so that's wrong. What am I missing?\n\nMaybe I should look at what letters are NOT possible."

You are also right that DGA is taken.\n\n    You're thinking about what's *not* possible, which is a great idea. Let's take it a step further. You know A=1. Consider the number 471. You know '1' corresponds to 'A'. So the last letter of the missing padlock must be 'A'. Now look at the other two letters. Which of the letters (D or G) can be used, and in what position, so that the resulting padlock hasn't already been used?"

                "student": "Okay, I see! Since A = 1, the last letter of the missing padlock must be A. So we have two options: ? ? A. The key is 471, so the letters must correspond to 4, 7, and 1.\n\nWe know D = 4 and G = 7. So the possibilities are:\n\nOption 1: D?A = 4?1. The missing number is 7, which is G. So DGA = 717. But DGA is taken.\nOption 2: ?DA = ?41. The missing number is 7, which is G. So GDA = 741. But GDA isn't an option, and DGA is taken.\n\nWait, I'm still missing something. Let me think...\n\nOkay, I see! We have 471, and we know A=1. So the last letter is A. Therefore, the padlock must end in A. Of the letters D and G, we know that D = 4 and G = 7. So we can write either DA or GA. If we have DA, the number would be 41. If we have GA, the number would be 71.\n\nSo if we have 471, and A=1, and D=4 and G=7. The padlock must be ? ? A. The key is 471. Since D=4 and G=7, then we have to use D and G in some order, ending in A. The only unused combination of those letters is D, since DGA and DAG are used already.\n\nSo the answer is D"

Then S=14 and the other numbers must add to 28. the remaining numbers would be 1,2,3,4,5,7,9. The smallest those four numbers could add to is 1+2+3+4 = 10. So that would work. What about 7?

Let's reiterate: Triangle (3 sides) has 1 region. Square (4 sides) has 8 regions. Pentagon (5 sides) has 13 regions. How many regions are added when going from the triangle to the square? How many are added when going from the square to the pentagon? Can you see a relationship to the number of sides?"

The pentagon adds 5 regions *only to the outside of the circle*, but the circle did not add any new regions to the square. I need to reconsider the circle between each polygon. The circle surrounding the triangle creates 3 new regions, making 4 regions total INSIDE the circle. Adding the square creates 4 regions OUTSIDE the circle, for 8 regions inside the square. The circle surrounding the square creates zero new regions. Adding the pentagon creates 5 regions, for a total of 13. Now, each additional side only contributes the *number of sides* to the count.

The circle had 3 added to it. So the total is 4 within the circle. Then the square includes these 4 + the 4 new ones for 8. The next circle doesn't add any. Then the pentagon adds 5 for 13 total, the next circle doesn't add any, and so on. So the total regions is the regions in the initial circle, plus the sum of sides from 4 to 16. The sum of sides is 4 + 5 + 6 + ... + 16. This is an arithmetic sequence. Number of terms is 16-4 + 1 = 13. So sum is (4 + 16) * 13 / 2 = 20 * 13 / 2 = 130. Then adding the 4 regions from the initial circle gives 134 regions. Still not the correct ground truth. I am missing something fundamental"

How many regions does the triangle create? How many regions does the square *add* on top of that? How many does the pentagon add, and so on? Remember to account for the fact that the triangle divides its circumcircle into regions as well. Keep tracking from the triangle onwards."

The triangle divides the inner circle into 3 regions, giving 1+3=4 regions inside the circle. 2. Square: The square adds 4 regions outside the circle. So the square has 4+4 = 8 regions. 3. Pentagon: Adds 5 regions outside the circle. Total 8+5 = 13 regions.  Each polygon adds its number of sides 'n' outside the current circle. So to find the total regions inside the 16-gon, I need to sum the number of sides from 3 to 16, then add the initial 1 region (inside the triangle). The sum from 3 to 16 is (3+16)* (16-3+1)/2 = (19 * 14)/2 = 19*7 = 133. Add to the initial region inside the triangle gives 133 + 1= 134. Still incorrect. Where did I go wrong again?

                "teacher": "You are SO close! You have correctly identified that the sum of the sides from 3 to 16 is 133. And also that the triangle has 1 region. Where you need to be careful is how many regions there are BEFORE you add the outer polygons. Think about the circumcircle of the triangle, that circumcircle divides the triangle into regions. And also keep in mind that regions add cumulatively. Consider the circumcircle of the triangle. You initially identified that there are four. So the sum should involve considering that initial split of regions."

                "student": "Okay, I think I finally understand! The *triangle* creates 1 region *inside itself*. Then the circumcircle creates 3 new regions, so there are 4 regions *inside the circle*. After that, each polygon adds regions equal to its number of sides. So I need to sum the sides from 4 to 16, *and* add the 4 regions from the triangle and its circle. The sum from 4 to 16 is (4+16)*(16-4+1)/2 = 20*13/2 = 130. Then I add the initial 4 regions within the circumcircle, so 130 + 4 = 134, But I know this is still not right. I had something similar before. Let me think... oh! Each polygon splits the region between the polygon one step before. The triangle is contained by the inner circle. So the inner circle defines some regions. The regions created by the triangle, are thus *already accounted for* when considering later shapes. It's just the *addition* of each polygon and the + 1 for the initial triangle region. So 1 (triangle) + 3 + sum(sides from 4 to 16)= 1 + sum(sides from 3 to 16) = 1 + (3+16)*14/2 = 1 + 19*7 = 1 + 133 = 134. Still wrong. I am close but missing something simple. How do I account for regions within the innermost circumcircle versus later polygons?"

                "teacher": "You're circling around the correct answer and the reasoning is almost perfect. Remember the construction process. The *triangle itself* creates 1 region, plus the circumcircle divides *the triangle* into *3* regions within the circumcircle. This gives a total of 4 regions. Now each polygon adds *new* regions. Therefore, think about it from the perspective: 1 (inside triangle) + [ (regions created by circle + polygons) ]. What did that innermost circumcircle do to the original area of the triangle? This is where you add them up."

                "student": "Okay! The triangle has 1 region. The *circumcircle surrounding the triangle divides it into 3 new regions*, giving 4 inside. The outer square creates 4 additional regions, The next outer circle does not add anything new. The next shape, the pentagon, adds five regions... Therefore, start summing at n=3. The sum from 3 to 16 is (3+16) * 14 / 2 = 133. But there is that 1 initial region *within the triangle*. The correct formula must then be 133 + *something*. What did that initial circle do? Ah I see. Let me reconsider, it's not the sum from 3 to 16! Consider the square: The triangle contributes one. The circumcircle creates 3 new regions. The square itself, however, creates new regions equal to 4 + 4. Each new regular n-gon creates n regions OUTSIDE THE INNER CIRCLE. And so all sides contribute to the ultimate total. Thus we sum over *all* the regions, each adds 'n' regions except the inner triangle itself. So we sum it starting from three, and add to that one extra triangle: sum(n) from n=3 to 16 plus that triangle. Which means: 1 + sum from 3+4+5+....+16 = 1+(3+16)*14/2 = 134. No! I always get this, missing one region. Oh!! It's not from 3, but it's sides from 3+number. I finally realized. Each splits regions. In circle is 3 more, then add all polygons! Thus there's no +1. The number within circle must be used! The number in inner circle. Thus: 3+sum(k from 4 to 16). This is the regions within circle + the sum total of polygon parts. And that number: inner regions: triangle:1, plus circle = 4, within square=4. From those we count up. 3+sum is wrong. I get all side sums and the regions from circle. Why not the GT! You mention regions each splits. Thus 3+ 4..16 is wrong! But triangle IS INSIDE that circle! AHH. Its 3 REGIONS FROM CIRCLE FROM DIVIDING THE T! And side additions. Is not +one. 3 new regions.

I can swap (1,1) and (3,1) and (2,1) and (4,1). This will take two swaps but I think there might be a better way. I also notice that if I swap the first and third rows, and the second and fourth rows, I will get the desired configuration. But I can only swap cells within the same row or column, not entire rows. Okay... I think I need to focus on getting one row or column correct. Let me try to get the first row correct first. The black cell is in the 3rd column. So, I need to swap the 1st and 3rd column to get the correct configuration. Then the second row will also be correct. Then I just need to get the third and fourth rows correct. To get them correct, I will just swap the 2nd and 4th columns. So that is two swaps. Wait! I think I can do better. Instead of swapping columns 1 and 3 initially, if I swap columns 1 and 3, then swap columns 2 and 4, I will get the desired configuation. But then I can also swap row 1 and 3, and row 2 and 4 to get the desired configuration. Oh, so I need to swap columns 3 and 4. After that, I can swap rows 1 and 2. So I have black cells at (3,3), (4,4), (1,1), (2,2). So these are four swaps. But I can actually swap (1,3) and (3,1). Then swap (2,4) and (4,2). This takes two swaps. Then I swap row 1 and 2 which I can't do. Oh! I think I see it now. I can swap cells (1,3) and (3,1), then swap cells (2,4) and (4,2). After that, I swap columns 1 and 2, and columns 3 and 4.

Each repeating unit has 1 octagon and 1 square, which shares 1 rod on each side with an octagon and shares 4 rods. So each octagon contributes 7 rods and each square contributes 2 rods... so that's 9 rods for each repeating unit. So the answer is 8 + 60 * (8-1 + 4-2) = 8 + 60 * 9 = 8 + 540 = 548? I'm still off."

Then NP = 8 and NQ = 1. Also, I know that MJ = MN, and MJ = KL since it is a rectangle. Since triangle MJN is isosceles, MJ = MN. And since JKLM is a rectangle, KL = MJ. Now, I know the distance from N to KL, and the distance from N to LM. I can say that KL - 8 = LM - 1 since N is on the diagonal. No, that's wrong. MJ = MN, so KL = MN. Let's draw a line parallel to KL from N. Now I have it! MJ = KL. MJ = MN. So KL = MN. Also, the distance from N to LM is 1, and the distance from N to KL is 8. That means that if I drop perpendiculars from N to KL and to LM, I create a smaller rectangle inside the big one. Let X be the point on KL where the perpendicular from N hits, and let Y be the point on LM where the perpendicular from N hits. Then KX = 8, and MY = 1.

Let X be the point on KL where the perpendicular from N hits, and let Y be the point on LM where the perpendicular from N hits. Then KX = 8 and NY = 1.

Since MJ = MN, and MJ = KL, then KL = MN. Now, KL = KX + XL, so KL = 8 + XL. Also, LM = LY + YM. Since JKLM is a rectangle, XL = YM. Therefore, LM = LY + XL. Also, since triangle JNM is isosceles, angle JNM = 45 degrees. Then, since angle KNM + angle JNM = 180, angle KNM = 135. Also, since KXL is a right angle and NYM is a right angle, KNX and NYM are right triangles. This is not useful. Triangle MNY is right. So tan(45) = MY/NY = MY/1. So MY = 1, and NY = XL.

How many rotations around the square are needed to restore the triangle's original orientation? How many rotations of the square are necessary for the marked point to be back where it started on the square? Once you determine those numbers, consider their least common multiple."

And after going around the square once, the point IS back where it started on the square. So, the least common multiple of 3 and 1 is 3. So the triangle rotates around the square 3 times. So there are 3 * 4 = 12 rotations! So I was right!"

The triangle has to go around the square *three* times to return to it's original state since it has 3 sides. Each time it goes around the square, the point touches 4 different arcs, and each arc has a measure of pi/3. It has to go around the square 3 times, so you should be able to see that the total distance travelled is 4*3*pi/3 = 4pi!"

Instead, think about the relationship between the center of the octagon, the vertex, and the point where the circle touches the diagonal. Is there a smaller, similar triangle you could work with that simplifies the calculations? Hint: Focus on the angle formed at the center of the octagon by two consecutive vertices."

The diagonal bisects the angle formed by connecting the center to two vertices, which makes a 22.5-degree angle. The distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is the apothem. The radius of the circle is the apothem of a smaller octagon made by the diagonals. If I focus on a right triangle formed by the center, the midpoint of a side, and a vertex, then tan(22.5) = (side/2) / apothem. Side = 10, so tan(22.5) = 5/r, and thus the radius is 5/tan(22.5). Wait a minute. The smaller octagon is such that all the inscribed diagonals touch the circle, so the radius of the circle is half the length of a side of the smaller octagon. The side length of the smaller octagon is 10*tan(22.5) so the radius is 5"

So, $9 \times 2 = 18$ cubes are removed there. The remaining columns, there are $5-3=2$, no wait, $5 \times 5 - 3 \times 3 = 25 - 9 = 16$ columns. Those columns have only one cube, the base. So the number of removed cubes there is $5 - 1 = 4$. So $16 \times 4 = 64$. So in total, $18 + 64 = 82$ cubes were removed."

There are 16 of those. And the original cubes were 5 high. And now they are only 1 high. So $5-1 = 4$. And $16 \times 4 = 64$ cubes. Oh, I see. I was calculating the *removed* cubes in the pillar columns correctly, but I said it wrong. It's $9 \times (5-3) = 9 \times 2 = 18$ cubes. It should be $9 \times (5-3) = 18$ cubes. The base has the $16 \times 4 = 64$ cubes removed. So $18 + 64 = 82$ cubes are removed. Wait, is that even right?"

Factoring out s gives s((5/4)s - 2) = 0. Thus, s = 0 or (5/4)s = 2, so s = 8/5. Wait, I got the same answer even though I made a mistake... Let me try again from (5/4)s^2 - 2s = 0. I can multiply by 4 to get 5s^2 - 8s = 0. Factoring out s, I get s(5s - 8) = 0.  So s = 0 or 5s = 8, which means s = 8/5. I still get the same answer. Is that correct?"

It could potentially work, but it's important to make sure you can accurately count the total number of parabolas and account for any overlaps. Are you confident you can do that accurately without missing any cases or double-counting? Alternatively, let's go back to your earlier insight about looking for symmetrical arrangements. Can you see any sets of 4 points arranged in a symmetrical way that would lie on the same parabola?"

If you systematically check each of those 76 cases for additional points, you will be able to arrive at the final answer. But is there an easier way, maybe by finding sets of 4 or more points which MUST belong to a single quadratic?"

The smallest 1 + c + d can be is 6, so 6 + a + b >= 6. Since a and b would have to be different from 1, 5, and 6, they'd have to be 2, 3, and 4 in some order.

Consider the total number of reflections necessary to return to the original side. How does that impact the total height and base of the larger similar triangle?"

So the height of the large triangle is still 2x, but x is now half of an odd integer. Let's call the odd integer k. Then x = k/2, and the height is 2(k/2) = k. So the ratio of height to base for the big triangle is k/base = 10/9, so base = (9/10)k. Since we want the *first* time it hits AB, we want the smallest odd integer k. That's k=1. Then base = 9/10.

Instead, I should be focusing on using the two equations to find N and E individually. So I have N+E = 23 and West = 2*South. From the pie chart, West is 24% and South is 12%. So the equation becomes N+E=47-24 which is N+E=23. How do I proceed from here?"

NO! this cannot be correct.\n\n    Okay I see the area to the top right is 3. This means the area to the top right must be in the ratio of 1/3 (from the base). So 3/(1+3) = A / (3+area), so we can relate 3 to the top right area. I still cannot figure out how to equate the ratios.\n\n    Okay the top right triangle has are 3, so the area 1/3 is 1, therefore 3/x=3 (from length/base), or areas x/3 =3.\n\n    "

Adding that to the original surface area X, the total surface area of all the small cuboids is (2lw + 2lh + 2wh) + (4lw + 4lh + 4wh) = 6lw + 6lh + 6wh = 3(2lw + 2lh + 2wh) = 3X. So the answer is C."

Because the sides are parallel we know that x corresponds to 11 and y corresponds to 15. That means the side of the larger triangle is 15 + 6 + x and also 11 + 12 + 6. Setting those equal gives 15 + 6 + x = 11 + 12 + 6, so x = 8. And doing the same for the smaller triangle, 12 + 11 + y = 15 + 6 + 12 so y = 8. Now I can find the perimeter!"

I need to rearrange my equations. The side length of the smaller triangle is y + 11 + 12 and also x + 6 + 12. Then y + 23 = x + 18. Then y = x - 5. Also the side length of the larger triangle is x + 6 + 15 and also y + 11 + 6 so x + 21 = y + 17, or y = x + 4. Now substituting I get x + 4 = x - 5, which doesn't make sense.

Try expressing L and S in terms of the hexagon's sides in *two different ways* each. This will give you two equations for L and two equations for S. This system should help you solve for x and y correctly."

So x - y = 2 and x - y = 8! Okay, I see I messed up the second equation. It should be S = 6+x+12 = 11 + 15 + y. Then x+18 = 26 + y so x - y = 8.

The side y is part of the smaller equilateral triangle and is adjacent to sides of length 11 and 12. That means that the sides x, 6, and 15 form one side of the LARGE equilateral triangle, so x + 6 + 15 = L. Also, the sides 12, 11, and y make up the side of the SMALL equilateral triangle, so 12 + 11 + y = S. But each side of the hexagon is parallel to the side opposite it. So x = 12 and y = 6.

Wait a minute. I made a mistake. Looking at the fourth column, 'L' * 7 = 56*. But that means 'L' = 8! My bad. Okay, let me look for where 6 * something = S. Okay 6 * 7 = 42, so S = 42. Hmmm. Second column. Something * 6 = S. Okay, so what times 6 = 42? Seven! And that something is K! Okay, so K = 7. Now I look at the first row. Something * 7 = 56. Seven times what is 56? 8! So, J, K, and L must be some numbers times 7. So J = something times 7, K = 7, and L= something times 7. Bottom row: 6 * something = T, T = 7. N must be something times 7. But in the third row, we see 8. Okay. Looking at third row * something = 8, that means the 'something' must be 6! Okay. And in fourth column something * 7 = N. Okay but that gives me the fact that N is 42. That's no good. Third row first cell, something times something equals M. Okay that gets me nowhere. It must be something in the first row. So K=7, looking at second row, and something * 7 = K, that means the something must be 1! But wait. 6 * 3 = 18. So P must be 3. So, third row, something times 6 = 8, which is false. So, third row, something * 7 = N. What is the first number in the column? 6. Wait a minute. The top row is a series of multiplications of 7. And E represents 7. OH!!! The answer is E!"

So a + b + c + d = 6 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 22. Which doesn't work. If I try 4 at the top... Then the numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

So it COULD be 1,3,7. The remaining numbers are 2,5,6. Let's try putting 1 and 7 at the bottom. So we have 4 at the top, 1 and 7 at the bottom. Then what numbers go in the middle?"

And the sum has to be the same for each side. Oh I think I see it now. The sum of each line is 12. 4+5+3 = 12, 4+2+6 = 12, and the bottom line is 1+5+6 = 12 or 7+2+3 = 12.

For E, the colored rectangle looks like 1/4 of the big square. So it's not E. For D, the triangle looks like it's half of a quarter of the big square, so that would be 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8.

Also, in B, the triangle takes half of the side. In D, it takes a quarter of the side. So B is wrong. The answer must be D."

Does the given order in each option match the order of the original strip (either forwards or backwards)? Or could it be achieved by folding? Perhaps try writing out the original sequence of shapes and testing each option by physically folding a piece of paper (or imagining it very carefully) to see if that sequence is possible."

Also, to really test A, could the circle ever end up *between* the black square and the black circle *after* any series of folds, given their original positions?"

The original order is circle, black square, star, white square, black circle. So the star, white square, black square part is in reverse order, compared to the original.

The second row has 3 red cells, and the second column has 3 red cells. The third row has 3 red cells, and the fourth column has 3 red cells. So there must be one empty cell each in the second row, second column, third row and fourth column. The last row is 1, so there are three empty cells there. The third column is 1, so there are three empty cells there. I see the problem! The 3 red cells in row 2 must be in columns 2, 3, and 4. The 3 red cells in column 2 must be in rows 2, 3, and 4. But the 4th row only has one red cell, so column 2, row 4 is red and columns 3 and 4 are not red in row 4. But the column sums for column 3 and 4 are 1 and 3 respectively, so column 3 must be red somewhere else, and the same for column 4. I think option E is impossible! So D is the answer."

If x=5, then y=10. Then 5*z = 1000, so z=200. 200 is also not in the list of allowed numbers. So the diagonal logic alone isn't sufficient."

The corresponding values of x = 1000/(1000/x) are {500, 250, 200, 100, 40, 10}. I can only use 100, so let's test if the ? is 100. Since 50, 1, and 20 are used, the possible values for 1000/x are {2, 4, 5, 10, 25, 100}. If 1000/? = 10, then the ? = 100. If that's the case, then I need the other number in the diagonal to multiply by 20 and 100 to get 1000. But that's not going to happen. So the something = z * questionmark = 1000. The questionmark has to be one of the provided numbers in the list. The first row has 20, 1 and 50. So far it's been a lot of trial and error, so how can I pick the ? most efficiently? "
