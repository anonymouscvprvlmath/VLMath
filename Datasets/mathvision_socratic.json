                "teacher": "Careful there! Double-check which numbers are actually on that side of the triangle. It looks like the known number on that side is actually 3, not 1. Can you find the missing number with that correction in mind?"

            {
                "teacher": "Almost! Let's go back to when we found the first number. Remember the top of the triangle is 7 and the left bottom is 1. Therefore the two missing numbers are the ones next to 7 and 1 respectively. The missing numbers are therefore 3 and 9. What is 3 + 9?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Oh! You are right. The missing numbers are 3 and 9. So the sum would be 3 + 9 = 12. No wait, the bottom side has 3 and 1. So it should be 7 and 3 as the missing numbers. Therefore 7 + 3 = 10"
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You're so close! Let's pinpoint where our calculation went astray. We correctly determined that each side sums to 10. One side includes 7, so the adjacent missing number is 3. Another side includes 3 (bottom right), so the adjacent missing number is 7. The other side includes 1 (bottom left), so the adjacent missing number is 9. However we are asked to add up the two numbers next to the ink. Which numbers are next to the ink?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Okay, the two numbers next to the ink are the missing numbers on the top and left sides. So that would be 3 and I thought it was 9, but it is actually next to the side with the 1 so it is wrong. The side with the 7 must add to 10, and since we are adding 7 and the side next to the ink it should be a different calculation. The two stained numbers are next to each other. So the answer must be 10 - 1 - 7 = 2. So the two numbers must be 2 to fulfill the 10 requirement."

                "student": "If they are in a straight line, then the total length will be more. But if they are connected in a bent way, they will take up less space from end to end."

            },
            {
                "teacher": "Excellent! So the answer is B because it's the most 'bent', meaning the two original strips are joined so that they create the smallest overall length. Great job working through that problem!"

            {
                "student": "Oh, I see! Each block actually has two white cubes OR three white cubes! Looking again, I now count that there are *four* blocks with three white cubes and *two* blocks with two white cubes. So that gives (4*3)+(2*2) = 12 + 4 = 16 white cubes total."

                "student": "Yes, I see it now! So each block has alternating colors, either starting with white or starting with grey. If a block starts with grey it will have 3 grey and 2 white cubes. If a block starts with white it will have 3 white and 2 grey cubes. I miscounted. So there are really *two* blocks with 3 white cubes, and *four* blocks with 2 white cubes. That means (2*3)+(4*2) = 6 + 8 = 14 white cubes!"

                "student": "Okay, I went back and checked each block individually, very carefully. There are *four* blocks with 3 white cubes and *two* blocks with 2 white cubes. So there are (4*3)+(2*2) = 12 + 4 = 16 white cubes."

            },
            {
                "teacher": "Okay, this is really close! It seems like the multiplication is right, but maybe the individual counting of the cubes isn't? Remember that the little cubes of equal colour don't touch each other, so they alternate colors. Take another look at each individual block and count the number of white cubes in each of the six blocks. Then add them all up."
            },

                "student": "I see now! Blocks 1, 2, 4, and 6 (from left to right) each have TWO white cubes. Blocks 3 and 5 each have THREE white cubes. So there are 4 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 8 + 6 = 14 white cubes. That means my initial multiplication and addition was correct, but I still miscounted how many white cubes are on each of the six blocks. ARGH!!"

                "teacher": "You're so close, and I admire your persistence! Let's take a slightly different approach. Instead of counting white cubes, what if we counted the grey cubes in each block? Each block has 5 cubes, so if you know the number of grey cubes, you can easily figure out the number of white cubes. Does that help?"
            },
            {
                "student": "I think so! If I count the grey cubes, then subtract that from 5, I'll know the number of white cubes in that block. Okay, let me try that... Block 1 has 3 grey cubes, so it has 2 white cubes. Block 2 has 3 grey cubes, so it has 2 white cubes. Block 3 has 2 grey cubes, so it has 3 white cubes. Block 4 has 3 grey cubes, so it has 2 white cubes. Block 5 has 2 grey cubes, so it has 3 white cubes. Block 6 has 3 grey cubes, so it has 2 white cubes. Adding those all up: 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 14. Still off! Where am I going wrong?!"

                "teacher": "You're doing great with the counting for each block individually! Now, let's zoom out a bit. You've correctly identified that blocks 1, 2, 4, and 6 each have 2 white cubes, and blocks 3 and 5 each have 3 white cubes. So, how many blocks have two white cubes, and how many have three? Think about *how many* blocks fall into each category."
            },
            {
                "student": "Okay, I'm still getting confused but I'm not giving up! Four blocks have two white cubes each. Two blocks have three white cubes each. So, the total number of white cubes is (4 * 2) + (2 * 3) = 8 + 6 = 14."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "That's a great breakdown of how you got to 14. Is there anything else you notice in the picture? For example, do the white cubes and gray cubes alternate in each block?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Yes, the white and grey cubes alternate in each block! Starting with grey, you have grey-white-grey-white-grey (2 white cubes). Starting with white, you have white-grey-white-grey-white (3 white cubes). So knowing that *should* help me find the number of white cubes... but I'm still stuck."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You're absolutely right, the alternating pattern is key! You've correctly identified that some blocks start with grey and some start with white. Now, carefully look at the *very top cube* of each block. Is it white or grey? How does that relate to whether the block has 2 or 3 white cubes?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Aha! If the top cube is grey, the block has 2 white cubes. If the top cube is white, the block has 3 white cubes! Looking at the image, two blocks have a white top cube (blocks 3 and 5), and the other four have grey top cubes (blocks 1, 2, 4, 6). So the total is still (2*3) + (4*2) = 6 + 8 = 14... I'm at a loss!"

If we look at blocks 1 and 2, can we be absolutely sure we're counting their white cubes correctly? Perhaps comparing them directly will reveal a mistake."

The figure on the face *opposite* to the kangaroo. Looking at both cubes, do you see any shape that *cannot* be adjacent to the kangaroo? Remember, opposite faces never share an edge, so they cannot be adjacent."

The cube on the right has the triangle, circle and arrow, so the triangle is next to the circle and arrow. So the triangle cannot be on the opposite face of the kangaroo because it's already next to other shapes."

It's 4 wagons away from wagon 7 (11-7=4). So the wagon next to wagon 11 will be 4 wagons away from wagon 12. So, 12-4 = 8. So wagon 8 is next to wagon 11."

If we color houses 3 and 5, we can color 1 or 4, giving us 3, 5, 1 and 3, 5, 4. Finally, if we color houses 3 and 6, we can color 1 or 4, giving us 3, 6, 1 and 3, 6, 4.

It can be 1 or 4, so two ways. If I color 3 and 5, I need one more house, and it can be 1 or 4. Two ways. If I color 3 and 6, I need one more house and it can be 1 or 4. Two ways. I must consider the case in which the path is broken. If the path isn't broken, it must pass from 2-5, 2-6, 3-5, or 3-6. Then there are two additional combinations that work {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}.

For each child, is their *right* hand being used to hold the hand of another child? Remember some children are facing backwards, which might affect how you see their right and left hands. Count carefully!"

            {
                "student": "Oh, I missed some! It intersects the ribbon 11 times. So there are 11 cuts."

            {
                "teacher": "Great job noticing that! So, if there are 11 cuts, how many pieces of ribbon will there be in the end?"
            },

            },
            {
                "teacher": "Fantastic! You got it. So the answer is 12 pieces of ribbon. The key here is to carefully count the intersections, and remember to add 1 to that number to find the total number of pieces."

The 4 can be broken down into 2 and 2, so 12 can be there. For 15, I need 3 and 5, and neither of those can be broken down further. So 15 can be in the shaded cell."

Then the square (4 new regions), a circle, a pentagon (5 new regions), a circle, and so on until the 16-sided polygon. I missed the 'circumcircle' step! That means the circumcircle doesn't add any regions. So it's 1 + 4 + 5 + 6 + ... + 16. I calculated that before. The sum from 4 to 16 is 158 - 1 - 2 -3 which would make the sum 1+4+5+...+16 =1 + (158-6) = 153"

When we add a circle around the prior polygon, we are adding to the region count inside the *newest* polygon. So the region within the triangle is the first. Then the square makes more regions, and so on. Can you calculate again?"
            },
            {
                "student": "I think I understand now. It should be the sum of integers from 3 to 15, plus one region for the initial triangle, plus one extra to get the circumcircle, and plus one to get the circumscribed square (we need to add to all the shapes with 3 and greater sides to make the sides outside the circle). Thus, it should be 1 + 4 + 5 + ... + 16 = 153 total."

            {
                "student": "I see now! The number of regions are bounded by the outer polygon with its number of sides, so if the largest outer shape is a 16-gon, then there will be sums of 4,5,6..16, which represents the additional numbers of regions starting with the region inside the square. The problem notes that we draw shapes until the 16 sides. We must remember the initial region inside the triangle. That should make 1 + 4 + 5 + 6 + ... + 16, which is 153 regions total. Also, we get the region inside the first triangle, hence 1+ ( (16 * 17)/2)-1-2-3) = 153"

So, it goes from 3 sides to 16 sides. The number of *additional* regions is the number of sides of the *new* polygon. We start with 1 region inside the triangle. Then we add 4 (square), then 5 (pentagon), ..., then 16 (16-gon). The sum is 1 + 4 + 5 + ... + 16 = 1 + (4 + 5 + ... + 16) = 1 + ( (16 * 17)/2 - (1 + 2 + 3) ) = 1 + (136 - 6) = 1 + 130 = 131.

This means CF is 80/9, thus FD = (4/5)*CF = (4/5)*80/9 = 64/9. The area of triangle ADC is AD*CD/2 = 12*16/2 = 96. This means ACF+ADF = 96.

The center cube is 1x1x1, so its volume is 1. The weight of that cube is 1 * 30 = 30 grams. Since I subtracted it twice I need to add that back in twice. So 540 + 2*30 = 540 + 60 = 600.

Then, the weight is 7 * 30 = 210. Wait, no. It should be 9-2 = 7! If I removed a total volume of 7. I subtracted the center 1x1x1 cube two extra times. 9-2=7 is the correct volume removed. 810- 7*30 = 810 - 210 = 600. It's still 600..."

Now, remember that the holes intersect at the *center* of the cube. But how does the material removed look? Are the removed pieces completely separate? Keep in mind that the three holes all intersect at the center 1x1x1 cube, but *extend* to the edges. Take another careful look at the image!"

The very center cube is intersected 3 times, one time for each hole. Also, there are intersections where only *two* of the holes overlap, each with volume 1. There are three of these. So the calculation is the original volume minus the intersection of all three minus the three cubes where 2 overlap. So 9-1-3. That's wrong.... Oh, I only subtract the *extra* volume! Thus, I have 3 * 3=9. Then I remove the center once. So that is -1. Then, for the remaining overlaps with two holes, I need to subtract 1 from each two of them because I was subtracting that volume twice, but each two of them only appear once! So I removed an extra 3 * 1 from this. So then it is 9-1-2. Wait, what am I even calculating? "

We know that the original cube has a weight of 810 grams and a volume of 27 cubic units. Ultimately, we're trying to figure out the weight of the cube *after* the holes are drilled. Remember your earlier good start with finding the weight per cubic unit. How can you use that along with the *total* volume that is removed from the cube to determine the final weight?"

But instead, I only want to take the center cube out once, So I removed the center cube twice too many. Since there are three intersections of two holes that are 1x1x1, that are not the center cube. So, I am subtracting one *extra* cube from each of these overlaps. Thus, the *total* volume is then equal to 9-3*1-2*1= 9-3-2 =4. Therefore, I am removing a volume of 4 instead of a volume of 9. So, 4*30 =120. Then 810-120 = 690."

Perhaps one that includes \\(\\angle BAD\\)?"

If you could find all the angles in quadrilateral ABCD, you could use the fact that the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees. You already found \\(\\angle BCD\\).

Let me think about triangle ABD. We know \\(\\angle ABD = 40^{\\circ}\\). If I only knew another angle in that triangle... Oh! I think I can find angle BAC. Since triangle ABC is isosceles, and angle ACB is 20, angle BAC is (180-20)/2 = 80. Now I can use the Law of Sines!"

Now, in triangle ABD, \\(\\angle ABD = 40^{\\circ}\\). I need to find \\(\\angle ADB\\). Wait! I see isosceles triangles. Triangle ABC is isosceles, so \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle ABC = 80^{\\circ}\\). Since BD bisects \\(\\angle ABC\\), \\(\\angle ABD = \\angle DBC = 40^{\\circ}\\). In triangle BCD, \\(\\angle DBC = 40^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\angle BDC = 80^{\\circ}\\), so \\(\\angle BCD = 60^{\\circ}\\). Then \\(\\angle BCA = 20^{\\circ}\\), so \\(\\angle ACD = 40^{\\circ}\\). Therefore triangle ACD is isosceles since \\(\\angle ADC = \\angle DAC = 70^{\\circ}\\). This means that \\(\\angle BAD = 80+70 = 150\\)"

In triangle ABD, angle ABD is 40 and angle ADB is 180 - 40 - angle BAD. I still need to find angle ADB. Triangle ACD is isosceles with AC=BC, so angles CAD and ADC are equal. So ADC = (180-40)/2 = 70. Angle BAD is angle BAC + angle CAD. Angle BAC is 80, and angle CAD is 70, so angle BAD = 30+40=70."

                "teacher": "That's right. The die returns to its original square, but the faces are not in their original positions. Let's focus on *how* the orientation changes with each roll. How many rolls does the die make in one complete circuit around the path?"

A standard die has 6 faces, but consider this: does each face necessarily have to be on top for the die to return to its *exact* original orientation?

If A is 22*** and the first two digits are 22, the range for A is 22000 to 22999. So B = 0 doesn't make sense and B = 1 doesn't make sense. If B is 2, that's a lot of digits. However, we know that A times the ones digit equals a number that ends in 2. The only number multiplied by 2 that ends in 2 is 1 and 6. So let's say B is 1, it won't work because 22*** times 1 should end in a number that has two as the ones digit. So the last digit of A would have to be 2 to make the problem work."

Notice how `22***` is obtained by multiplying the top number, `A`, by 100. This tells us that `A` must be equal to 22 followed by three more digits. The bottom number (1**) when multiplied by A results in a number that has 56 as the first two digits. The three partial products must add up to 56. Let's try to reconstruct this multiplication problem. What do you think the value of A is, given the result of the multiplication problem?"

Since the number is at least 9000, we divide it by 22*** and we get 0.04. So this is not the correct number. Also, we know 100 * A is 22***. From the looks of it, I'm just going to guess that the number is 22441 * 121 = 2715361. 2 + 7 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 25"

While guessing can sometimes lead to the answer, it's generally more reliable to use the information we have to deduce the missing digits. You correctly observed that the last partial product is obtained by multiplying the top number by the units digit of the bottom number, resulting in a number that ends in 2. You also correctly looked at 90* and divided that by something. However, let's focus on the units digit of the bottom number.\n\n    Notice the second partial product `90*`. Since this comes from multiplying `A` by the tens digit of `1**`, it implies that 9000 is the approximated value of tens digit multiplied by A. That would mean that the middle digit is very small because 22*** * 100 gave 22***. What does that imply for the second digit?"

                "teacher": "Wonderful! That's the correct value for the radius. Now, look at the answer choices again. Do any of them match your result? If not, think about how you might manipulate your answer to match one of the given forms. Notice that 1 - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 - 1/sqrt(2). Can you work that form into one of the answer options?"

                "student": "I think I made an error. The correct equation should be: distance from the corner to the center of the large circle (sqrt(2)/2) equals the distance from the corner to the center of the small circle PLUS the radius of the large circle. That means sqrt(2)/2 = r*sqrt(2) + r +1 - r . So sqrt(2)/2 = the radius of the large circle (sqrt(2)/2) = the diagonal corner to corner of the little square is r multiplied by root 2, added to the radius of the small circle which = (3-2sqrt(2))."

Now, consider the line segment from the corner of the square to the center of the *small* circle. What does *that* consist of? Isn't it the radius of the small circle *plus* the distance we already calculated, r*sqrt(2)?"

                "student": "Oh, right! The distance from the corner of the *large* square to the center of the *large* circle is sqrt(2)/2, which is also the radius of the large circle. The distance from the corner of the large square to the center of the *small* circle is r*sqrt(2). Then, the distance from the center of the small circle to the large circle along that diagonal is just r, the radius of the small circle. So sqrt(2)/2 = r*sqrt(2) + r, which factors into sqrt(2)/2 = r(sqrt(2) + 1), thus r = sqrt(2)/(2*(sqrt(2) + 1)). Rationalizing, we get r = (sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 1)) / (2*(2-1)) = (2 - sqrt(2))/2 = 1 - sqrt(2)/2. But I still don't see that in the answer choices..."

It's asking for the value of r in relation to the *side length* of the square, which is 1. Look closely at answer choice E and remember our goal is to find a way to write 1 - sqrt(2)/2 in the same form. What do you notice?"

I see. The answer choice is 3-2sqrt(2). If I draw a line from the center of the large circle, it will equal sqrt(2)/2. That's equal to the radius of the small circle plus the diagonal from the center of the small circle to the corner, or r + r*sqrt(2). If I move down along the diameter, past the small circle, the diameter of the large circle equals the diameter of the small circle plus two times r*root2, plus two times the radius of the small circle, so sqrt(2) = 2r + (2r)*sqrt(2). Factoring out the 2r gets sqrt(2) = 2r(1+ sqrt(2)). I was overcomplicating the calculation, but now if I look at the drawing, I see that the final answer is (3-2sqrt(2)) is correct. "

How does the length of the base PA compare to the length of the base AB? And how does the height from C to PA compare to the height from C to AB?

While the *heights* you're considering may be the same, remember that to calculate the area of triangle PAC, you need the perpendicular height from C to the line containing PA.

The area of ABR is 2. The area of BCR is 1. The area of ABS is 2. The area of ACT is 2 and area of BCU is equal to area of BAS which equal to 2. The area of CAU is 1.

Substituting into the first equation gives $a + b + b^2/(4a) = -10$, or $4a^2 + 4ab + b^2 = -40a$. The left side is $(2a+b)^2 = -40a$. A square cannot be negative so $-40a$ must be positive, meaning $a$ has to be negative. Since $(2a+b)^2$ is always positive/zero, $a<0$ ALWAYS. So, $a>0$ CANNOT be true since a is negative, which makes E the correct answer. I was confused because I was thinking that the picture meant $a<0$. Now I see that $a<0$ always because of $a+b+c=-10$ and $b^2 = 4ac$."

If I removed a 1x1 cube for each of the 9 pillars, that's removing 9 cubes from the first layer, 9 from the second layer, and 9 from the third layer.

If I remove a small cube from each of the 9 positions to lower the pillars, that means the 9 cubes at the bottom are ALREADY gone. So I just need to think about the top. I removed 3 cubes from each of the 9 pillars, and the number of cubes removed is then 3 cubes * 9 pillars + 1*9 for those holes in the bottom of the cube = 27 + (5*5 - (9)) = 27+16= 43.

Now I build this structure. The base is still there, and it's 5x5, but there are 9 holes, so 25-9 = 16 cubes in the base. The pillars are 2 high, so that's 2 layers high. Hmmm.... I removed 3 layers above the pillars, and there are 5x5 = 25 cubes in each layer. But the pillars are in the way. 25*3 = 75 cubes REMOVED from the top. But that includes the pillars!

So the number of cubes removed is 3 high for each pillar, which is 27 cubes removed from the pillars. Then, to make space for the pillars to stand on the ground, I had to remove more cubes. Wait... I already counted that! I removed 3 cubes. Each pillar started at the base, and the height of the pillar is 2. So I removed 3. Okay... the question says, 'How many little cubes have been removed?'

Same for the second layer, since the pillars are 2 high. Now for the third layer, the pillars don't go that high, so it is removing 25-9=16 again. Okay, so 16+16 + x = total cubes removed, where x = number removed from the bottom 2 layers. For the bottom layers, I remove the pillars. Each pillar needs 3 cubes to go away, for 9 * 3=27. So I remove 3 layers for each pillar, 25 in each layer. That's 75 cubes. The pillars are each 2 cubes, so 9 * 2 = 18 for the pillars. 75-18= 57 to remove the top 3 layers.

                "student": "We want to find x:y, which is the same as x/y. So I need to rearrange the equation 5x = y(8-x) to get x/y on one side."

                "student": "I can divide both sides by y to get 5x/y = 8-x. Then I can divide both sides by 5 to get x/y = (8-x)/5."

            {
                "teacher": "Good job! You're getting closer. However, notice that x/y is still in terms of x. Can you think of another way to manipulate the equation 5x = y(8-x) so that you can get x/y on one side and a constant on the other side?"

                "student": "That gives me 5x = y(8-x). Dividing both sides by y gives 5x/y = 8-x, then dividing both sides by (8-x) won't help. Dividing the original equation by xy gives 5/y = (8-x)/x, which also doesn't isolate x/y. Hmm..."

                "student": "Okay, expanding the right side gives 5x = 8y - xy. Now I want to get all the terms with x on one side, so 5x + xy = 8y. Factoring out x gives x(5+y) = 8y. Then x/y = 8y / (y(5+y))"

            {
                "teacher": "That's a great observation. It seems like directly solving for x/y or y alone isn't getting us to a numerical answer. Let's think back to the geometry of the problem. We have two rectangles with equal areas. Is there anything else we can infer from the diagram itself, perhaps about the relationships between the sides of the rectangles?"

            {
                "student": "Oh, I see! I can test each answer choice to see if it satisfies the equation. If x:y = 5:3, then x = 5k and y = 3k for some constant k. Substituting into the equation, 5(5k) = 3k(8-5k), so 25k = 24k - 15k^2, so k = -15k^2, but this doesn't work since k cannot be zero. If x:y = 8:5, then x=8k and y = 5k. Substituting, 5(8k) = 5k(8-8k), so 40k = 40k - 40k^2, so k = k - k^2. This means k^2 = 0 and k = 0, which also doesn't work. If x:y = 3:5, then 5(3k) = 5k(8-3k), so 15k = 40k - 15k^2. This means 25k = 15k^2 or k = 5/3. Then x = 3k = 5 and y = 5k = 25/3. 5(5) = (25/3) (8-5) = (25/3)(3) = 25. This works! So x:y = 3:5."

Then, I can do the third, fourth, and fifth, which changes the fifth square. So, that's two moves for just the first row."

If I flipped the last three, the third would be black, the fourth would be black, and the fifth would be black. So, I don't think one move is enough.

Now, the rules say you can only change *adjacent* fields in a horizontal *or* vertical line. With that in mind, consider the columns. How many moves would it take to fix just the *first* column?

If X was 2, then a would be 3, and b+c would be 5, which works with 2 and 3. Hmmm... X + a = b + c ... 6 + 2 is 8. Not possible. 4 + 2 = 6, so 3 + 3? No. So 2 + 3 = 5, so 6 doesn't work... if X = 2, then a, b, c = 3, 4, 6 so 3 = 4 + 6? No. I think it might be X = 2"

The triangle formed by the quadrilateral and the little triangle with area 1 shares the same height from vertex A, and its base is 3b. So its area must be 3 times the area of the small triangle with area 1. Therefore the area of the entire triangle formed by the quadrilateral and the area 1 is 3.

The areas 1 and 3 tells me the base of the triangle area 3 is 3 times area 1. This means that the base of the area 3 is three times the base of the area 1.

You know the smaller triangle on the left has area 1 and base 'b', and the larger triangle (quadrilateral plus the area of '3') has base '3b'. Therefore, the larger triangle's area is 3.

            {
                "student": "First I subtracted 205 from 2005 and I got 1800. Then I subtracted 1300 from 1800 and got 500. So the butterfly is covering 500."

                "teacher": "That's a good start! You correctly identified that each quarter moves the minute hand. However, instead of counting each move, is there a way to simplify how the minute hand moves around the clock? Think about how many quarters it takes for the minute hand to go all the way around the clock."

                "student": "Yes! We can divide 17 by 4 to see how many full rotations there are."

            {
                "teacher": "Perfect! So, after the minute hand goes around 4 times, it ends up back where it started. And then, it moves one more quarter. Given this, which position will the minute hand be in?"

Think about how the paper was folded."

After the exchange, he had toys that cost 125 KC. So, the toy he exchanged *out* was 5 KC more expensive than the toy he exchanged *in*. Which pair of toys in the picture has a price difference of 5 KC?"

            },
            {
                "student": "The smallest value could be 3, if 1 and 2 were used. But if that's the case, we cannot use 0. If we use 0 and 1, it would be 1."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "That's right! If we use 0 and 1, it would be 1. However, consider the implications of a carry-over to the middle column, or not. Can we try and find a solution to the addition problem using 1 in the gray box?"
            },
            {
                "student": "I'm trying to find a combination that works with 1 in the gray box, but I keep running into conflicts with using the digits only once. Like, if the right column is 0+1=1, the next one has a carryover and its not possible."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You're on the right track noticing those conflicts. That suggests 1 might not be the right answer. Let's jump to the other end and see whether we can try to build a solution with a 5 in the gray box."
            },
            {
                "student": "Okay, if the grey box is 5, then the two digits above it must add up to 5 or 15. The only combination of digits from 0-6 that add to 15 is 6+9, but 9 isn't an option. So they must add up to 5. That could be 0+5, 1+4, or 2+3. But we can't use 5 in the ones digits spot, so its either 1+4 or 2+3."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "That's excellent progress! You've narrowed it down significantly. Now, try building the rest of the addition problem using 5 in the grey box and see if you can make it work with the remaining digits. Can you place the numbers in the boxes?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Okay, so if I put 2 and 3 in the rightmost column, that makes the grey box 5. Then I have 0, 1, 4, and 6 left. I can put 6 and 0 in the next column, which gives me 6 with a carry-over of 0. Then I put 1 and 4 in the leftmost column. Oh wait, I can't since there is a 1 that carry overs to the left, and I need to get a 1. Hmmm..."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "Remember, you already listed all the combinations. And you know the value cannot be 1 and 4. Try focusing on 2 + 3 = 5. You also need a carryover from the tens column to hundreds column. If you arrange them in the correct order, you should arrive at the correct solution."
            },
            {
                "student": "I got it! 14 + 41 = 55 + something that causes 5 in the right column. I can also have the gray box be 5. But how do I arrange the numbers in a way such that the addition is correct?"
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You're thinking along the right lines with focusing on the carry-over to the next column, and you almost listed out the final solution. Try setting up the right side such that 3 + 2 = 5 and see what you can do to add. What numbers are left? Remember you have 0, 1, 4, and 6 left! You also need a carryover."
            },
            {
                "student": "Okay, I think I see it now! If the numbers in the right column are 2 and 3 (in either order), that gives me 5 in the grey box. Then I can use 1 and 4 in the tens place, which gives me 5, plus a carry-over of 0, so that will be 14 + 41. But this gives an answer of 55! So I must have to use 0 and 6 next. Since it sums to 6, and a carry over of 0, the solution is 12+43 = 55. The digits I have left are 0 and 6, so the numbers should have been 62 + 03 to give a total value of 65, and there will be no carryover to the next value, and so the digits can be used only once. Thus, 5 is in the grey box."

                "teacher": "Yes, that's correct! Excellent work. By systematically considering the possibilities and constraints, you arrived at the correct answer. The digit in the grey box must be 5. You explained your reasoning very well. Congratulations!"

Perhaps there's some overlap in the pins used between photos. Take a closer look at how the photos are connected. How many pins are used for the first photo? Then, how many *additional* pins are needed for each photo after that?"

                "teacher": "Thanks for explaining your approach. I see how you considered the 3 colors and the 5 regions. However, the problem states a key condition: \"She paints with different colors the regions that touch each other.\" Does your calculation of 27 account for this restriction? Why or why not?"
            },
            {
                "student": "No, it doesn't. I just multiplied the possibilities without considering that touching regions can't have the same color."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "Great! You've identified the crucial constraint. So, let's think about this step-by-step. Let's start with the innermost region. How many color choices do you have for that first region?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Since there are no restrictions for the first region, I can choose any of the 3 colors."

            {
                "teacher": "Exactly! Now, let's move to the region directly surrounding the innermost one. How many color choices do you have for this region, considering it must be a different color from the region it touches?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Since it can't be the same color as the first region, I only have 2 color choices left."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "Correct! And what about the next region out? How many color choices does it have, keeping in mind it can't be the same color as the region it touches?"
            },
            {
                "student": "It also only touches one region, so it also has 2 choices."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You're doing great! Now, continue this reasoning for the remaining regions. How many choices does each subsequent region have?"

                "teacher": "Perfect! So, you have 3 choices for the first region, and then 2 choices for each of the remaining regions. How can you combine these choices to find the total number of ways to paint the figure?"

            {
                "teacher": "Precisely! When the colors alternate, the outermost region has only one choice because it *can* be the same color as the innermost region. So, how does this affect our calculation? Can we modify it to account for this alternating possibility?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Hmm. If I fix the color of the first two regions, the rest are also fixed. Since I have 3 options for the first, and two for the second, the total should be 3 times 2 = 6?"

To make the sums equal, we need to move some value from the bottom row to the top row. If we flip a card, we are essentially subtracting a value from one row and adding it to the other. What value needs to be moved to make the sums equal?"

                "teacher": "Almost there! You're right that a net transfer of 2 from the bottom to the top is needed. Now, think about what happens when you flip a card. You're essentially replacing one number with another. So, the *difference* between those two numbers must be twice the amount you need to transfer. Why twice?"

If I flip it, the top row will decrease by 8 and increase by 7, so the top row will decrease by 1. And the bottom row will increase by 8 and decrease by 7, so it will increase by 1. I need to move 2. So, the total change needs to be 4. Card E has 8 and 7. That won't work. Card F has 3 and 7. If I flip it, the top row goes down by 3 and up by 7. The change is 4! That's it!"

            {
                "student": "Oh, I see. Card E has 8 and 7. 8 - 7 = 1. That's not 4. So I need the difference between the top and bottom to be 4... It's still card E, but I said the wrong numbers. If I flip card E, I subtract 8 from the top row and add 7. The difference is one! Something is not right..."
            },

                "teacher": "You're on the right track! The goal is not to calculate the overall change in value but, instead, to see if flipping card E makes the rows equal. Can you explain your current reasoning for choosing card E, and maybe we can work from there?"

                "teacher": "Exactly. Let's refocus. You correctly calculated the sums of the rows and found a difference of 4. You also realized that flipping a card transfers a value from one row to the other. You need a card where the difference between the top and bottom numbers is 4. Re-examine each card and see if you can find it."

                "student": "Yes, because flipping card E changes the top row by subtracting 8 and adding 7, and it changes the bottom row by adding 8 and subtracting 7. That means the top row is now 31 - 8 + 7 = 30, and the bottom row is 35 + 8 - 7 = 36. If only it moved the sums by 2..."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You're so close! Let's take a step back and look at the original problem. Remember *why* the difference between the top and bottom numbers on the card you flip needs to be 4. Consider what happens to the *difference* between the row sums when you flip the card."

Flipping a card changes the top row by -x and +y, and it changes the bottom row by +x and -y, where x and y are the numbers on the card. I want the new difference to be 0. The change in the difference is +4 or -4. If I flip Card E, it changes the difference by... That's not right. Let me rethink this."

                "teacher": "It sounds like you're getting a bit turned around in the details. The core idea is to reduce the difference between the sums to zero by flipping one card. And you know the current difference is 4. Think about this: what happens to the *difference* between the row sums when you flip a card? Does it increase or decrease? By how much does it change?"

                "student": "If the difference is 4, and I want it to be 0, then I need to subtract 4 from the bottom row (or add 4 to the top row). Flipping a card subtracts from one row and adds to the other... wait! Flipping a card changes the *difference* by twice the difference of the numbers on the card! So I need to find a card where the difference between the numbers is 2. Then, flipping that card will change the difference between the row sums by 4, making them equal! Okay... 8 - 7 = 1. 5 - 3 = 2! Card B!"

            {
                "student": "Yes! The top row is 31 and the bottom row is 35, so the difference is 4. Card B has 5 and 3. The difference between those is 2. When I flip card B, the top row becomes 31 - 5 + 3 = 29, and the bottom row becomes 35 + 5 - 3 = 37. BUT... because I flipped the card, I only changed one row, but really both rows changed in opposite directions by 2. So, if I reduce the difference between the rows to zero, then flipping the card must change the difference by 4. Since I calculated that the difference between 5 and 3 is 2, so that will get me there!"

If F is opposite to D in the first net, we need to find the letter that corresponds to F in the *second* net. Notice that the two nets aren't oriented the same way.

That's a total of 6 vertical and 2 horizontal. But that goes past A... Wait! What if it jumps 3 vertical and 1 horizontal, then 3 horizontal and 1 vertical, then 3 vertical and 1 horizontal. That totals 4 vertical and 2 horizontal! So the answer is 3 jumps."

                "teacher": "That's a great start! You're right, the number in the third circle will always be divisible by 3. But does that mean only *one* of the numbers will be divisible by 3? Remember, the question asks about *all* six numbers.  Can you think of any starting numbers that might make *other* circles also contain multiples of 3?"

However, to be *absolutely* sure, we need to check all six circles for divisibility by 3, *and* we need to think about whether choosing a *different* starting number might change the final count of multiples of 3. What are the next numbers in the sequence when you start with 2, and are they divisible by 3?"

Can you explain why the *other* numbers in the sequence are *never* multiples of 3, no matter what starting number you choose?

The third is the second number plus 1, which is the first number plus 2, and then that is multiplied by 3. The fourth is 3 times (first number + 2) + 2. The fifth is 2 times that. So the fourth number is always 2 more than a multiple of 3. So it can't be a multiple of 3. And the last number is just twice that, so it also can't be a multiple of 3. And the second number is one more than the first number, so if the first number isn't a multiple of 3, the second number won't be either."

However, let's look at the second number a little more closely. You said, \"if the first number isn't a multiple of 3, the second number won't be either.\" Is that always true? What if the first number leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3? Then what happens to the second number?"

The angle HAC is equal to \\( \\alpha \\) and the angle AHC is 90 degrees, so the angle ACH is equal to \\( 90 - \\alpha \\). Now I can proceed."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "Wonderful! Now consider the triangle formed at the intersection of AD and BH. You know one angle is 4\u03b1 and you've found an expression for angle ACH. Can you relate these angles and \\( \\alpha \\) to find the value of \\( \\alpha \\) and subsequently angle CAB?"
            },
            {
                "student": "I think so. The angle between AD and BH is an exterior angle to the triangle formed by A, H, and the intersection of AD and BH. The exterior angle 4\u03b1 is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles, which are \u03b1 and the angle at H in that small triangle where BH and AD intersect. But, I need the angle AHC. This value is \\( 90-\\alpha \\). Using the small triangle that involves the angle of \\( 4\\alpha \\), \\( 4\\alpha \\) is an exterior angle and therefore is equal to \\( (90 - \\alpha) + \\alpha \\). Thus, \\( 4\\alpha = 90 + \\alpha \\). Solving for \\( \\alpha \\), I get \\( 3\\alpha = 90 \\), or \\( \\alpha = 30 \\). Since angle CAB is equal to \\( 2\\alpha \\), then angle CAB is equal to 60 degrees."

                "student": "Okay, the area of the left triangle is (1/2) * b1 * h1, and the area of the right triangle is (1/2) * b2 * h2. So the sum of the areas is (1/2) * b1 * h1 + (1/2) * b2 * h2 = 10."

                "teacher": "It might seem that way, but let's try a different approach using what we know about h1 + h2 = h. Instead of substituting, let's go back to the equation (1/2) * b1 * h1 + (1/2) * b2 * h2 = 10. Can we factor anything out or rearrange the terms to make it simpler, keeping in mind our goal of relating this to the rectangle's area?"

To rationalize the denominator, I multiply the numerator and denominator by $7 - 4\\sqrt{3}$. That gives $\\frac{108(7 - 4\\sqrt{3})}{49 - 16*3} = \frac{108(7 - 4\\sqrt{3})}{1} = 108(7 - 4\\sqrt{3}) \\approx 8.9$."

That means that I can make the number 111, 14, 41, and 6. The number '1' by itself doesn't work, since I need to use all 6 sticks. I think my answer is 4."

Let me see...it can go Right, Diagonal, Down. It can go Right, Down, Diagonal. It can go Down, Right, Diagonal. And it can go Down, Diagonal, Right. So that's 4 total routes!"

What *does* exist are the two triangles next to the rectangle. How do the areas of the *two small triangles* relate to *these* triangles next to the rectangle?"

So, the two triangles on either side of the rectangle would make another rectangle the same size. Therefore, the area of the trapezium is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the two triangles, which is the same as two rectangles. So, 1.5 times 13."

Notice that shape E can be divided into four triangles, each with a base and height of 2, whose area is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 2 * 1 = 1. Therefore the total area is 4 triangles * 1 = 4. Now, compare that to your previous answer for shape D. Does that change your answer?"

                "student": "I see it now! We have that angle BAC = 180 - 2x, and angle DAE = 150 - 2x. I messed up earlier, because angle DAC = angle DAE, which is 150 - 2x. But also angle BAC = angle BAD + angle DAC. So 180 - 2x = 30 + (150 - 2x). That doesn't help."

                "teacher": "You're very close! Think about the angles around point A. We know \\(\\angle BAC\\), \\(\\angle BAD\\) and \\(\\angle DAC\\). How are these related, and can that help you find a fixed value for \\(\\angle CDE\\)?"
            },
            {
                "student": "Okay, I think I see. We said angle CDE = 135 - 2x. We know that angle BAD = 30 degrees, and angle ABC = angle ACB = x. Since AB = AC and AD = AE, then angle CDE is constant, independent of x. So 135-2x must be a number. Oh... wait. angle BAC + ABC + ACB = 180, so angle BAC = 180 - 2x. Also angle DAC = BAC - BAD, so DAC = (180 - 2x) - 30 = 150 - 2x. Also, triangle ADE is isosceles, so angle ADE = angle AED. Angle DAE = DAC, so angle DAE = 150 - 2x. Therefore angles ADE = AED = (180 - (150 - 2x))/2 = (30 + 2x)/2 = 15 + x. Finally, angle CDE + angle EDA + angle ADB = 180. angle ADB = 180 - 30 - x = 150 - x. angle EDA = 15 + x, so angle CDE = 180 - 15 - x - 150 + x = 15. It's 15 degrees!"

However, \\(\\angle VXW\\) (same as \\(\\angle VWX\\)) is already accounted for as 60 degrees within the equilateral triangle VWX. Instead, think about the angles that make up a full circle around point X: \\(\\angle VWX\\), \\(\\angle VXY\\), \\(\\angle YXZ\\), and \\(\\angle VXW\\). You know three of these.  Which angle are we actually trying to find the measure of right now to help us solve the problem?"

Then I used the 80 degree angle given in the problem, and the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360 to find the angle WXY. That allowed me to determine that triangle WXY was an isoceles triangle, and to find angles XYW, and XWY. Then I added VWX and XWY to find the answer."

So, to reiterate, planting in B balances the path separating B from A/D, leaves the path separating C/E from A/D balanced, but unbalances the path separating A/B from D/E.

Or perhaps you could try to eliminate locations based on whether they balance at least one of the paths. For example, we already know planting the tree in region A doesn't work and planting the tree in region B doesn't work. So now which regions should we check, and where do you want to start?"

            },
            {
                "student": "Okay. The path separating A/B from D/E would have 1 tree on the A/B side and 3 trees on the D/E side. Planting in E changes that to 1 tree on the A/B side and 4 trees on the D/E side, so region E does *not* work."

                "teacher": "That's correct. It seems we made an error, which is a good reminder to always double-check! You've eliminated A, B, C, and D. And you just showed that E doesn't work. That leaves us with... wait a minute! There's something we missed. Take a closer look at the diagram and the original problem. Is there anything we might have overlooked in our interpretation?"

Putting 7 in the shaded box allows you to complete the grid using the remaining numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6 without any contradictions, and satisfying all the given conditions. The top middle box is 12 - 3 - 7 = 2. The top left is 12-4-2=6.

However, since rows 3 and 4 have 0 red cells, that means that columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 can have a maximum of 2 red cells in the first two rows. But columns 2 has 3 red cells, which is a contradiction. So C is impossible."

Let me try to create a grid for option D. \n\nI can make the first row have 2 red cells in columns 1 and 2. Then the second row has 1 red cell in column 1. Then the third row has 2 red cells in columns 3 and 4. Finally, the fourth row has 2 red cells in columns 3 and 4. The columns sums are correct. So it is possible to create a grid for option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."

It states, \"The total area of the shaded parts of the heptagon is 1 cm^2.\" and \"The area of the original triangle is 1 1/2 times the area of the heptagon.\" Does the 1 cm^2 represent the *entire* area of the heptagon, or only a *portion* of it? Look closely at the heptagon in the diagram."

                "teacher": "Exactly! The area of the original triangle equals the area of the heptagon plus the area of the shaded region. So, we have two expressions for the area of the triangle: 1.5 * H and H + 1. Can you set up an equation and solve for H?"

The diagonal from the top right to the bottom left contains 50. So something times something times 50 must equal 1000. That means the product of the other two numbers must be 20.

I also know that the middle row must be 10 * x * y = 1000, where y is the last number in the middle row. So x*y = 100. The numbers left are 2, 4, 25 and 100. Okay, if x is 4, then y is 25. If x is 25, then y is 4. If x is 2, then y is 50, but 50 is already used. If x is 100, then y is 1, but 1 is already used. The question mark cannot be 25 because the last column would be 50, 25 and 4, and 50*25*4 does not equal 1000. So the answer must be 4."

But also notice, the graph goes above 7 meters briefly between 10 and 11 seconds. So the second interval is more like 9 to 11. Adding them, it is more like 2 seconds.

You've correctly identified the two main intervals. Can you look *really* closely at the x-axis (time) at the points where the graph crosses the 4-meter line and the 7-meter line?

Instead of calculating the intervals, let's count the seconds directly from the graph. Can you count how many seconds the graph stays between the 4 and 7 meter lines? Remember to estimate fractions of seconds as accurately as possible."

Let's go back to the beginning and think through each step slowly. First, can you identify all the times when the elevation is between 4 and 7 meters? List them out as accurately as possible."

                "teacher": "Good, now let's refine those endpoints a bit. Look *very closely* at where the graph crosses the 4-meter line the *first* time. Is it exactly at 3 seconds? Is it a little before or a little after? The same question goes for where the graph crosses the 7-meter line."
            },

                "student": "Okay, looking *really* closely... the first crossing of the 4-meter line looks like it's a little *after* 3 seconds, maybe 3.25 seconds? And the crossing of the 7-meter line looks like it's a little *before* 7 seconds... maybe 6. So the first interval is 6 - 3.25. Then the second interval starts at 9 and goes to about 13. So that is (6 - 3.25) + (13 - 9) = 2.75 + 4 = 6.75. Still not 8! I quit!"

But take a look at where the graph crosses the *second* 4-meter line. It's closer to the 6 second mark than the 7 second mark! So, what is the second 4-meter crossing? And with that in mind, what is the length of the first interval?"

Thus, the amount of time it is between 4 and 7 meters is (6 - 3.25) + (12-9) = 2.75 + 3 = 5.75. Still not 8!"
            },

                "teacher": "You're doing great! Remember we're looking for the amount of time the elevation is *between* 4 and 7 meters, not *above* 4 and *below* 7. Re-examine those endpoints and calculate the length of each interval again. You have interval one correct, but the second interval's *end point* needs more examination."

But if I estimate it differently, I get the first interval to be (5-3) and the second interval to be (13-9). So (5-3) + (13-9) = 2 + 4 = 6. Now, if I say that the graph crosses the 4-meter line at approximately 3 seconds and 5 seconds. The graph crosses the second 4 meter line at about 9 seconds and 13 seconds, it is more like (5-3) + (13-9) = 2 + 4 = 6. This is so confusing! How about this. I see the interval is *approximately* at 3-5 seconds, and then again at 9-13 seconds. I have no clue how to make it exactly 8."

However, if you look *really* closely at the graph between 12 and 13 seconds, you'll see it curves back down to 4 *before* 13 seconds. What would you estimate is the best approximation for that crossing?"

                "student": "Okay, I see it now! Let me try to zoom in. The time that the graph crosses the 4 meter line is *approximately* 12 seconds after 9 seconds. It looks like the graph crosses the 4-meter line at approximately 3 seconds and 5 seconds. So it is (5-3) + (12-9) = 2 + 3 = 5. I am off by three! Why is the correct answer 8? It feels like a trick!"
