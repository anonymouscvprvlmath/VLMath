# Dataset generation code
This folder contains the code and notebooks used to create the dataset.
Note that it does not share the same environment as the training setup, since the dataset was generated separately and later cleaned before being used for training.
Therefore, this folder is intended to demonstrate the dataset creation process, rather than serve as a modular pipeline for generating other datasets or prompts.
