Raw response:  To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of red to blue candles, which is 5:3. This means that for every 5 red candles, there are 3 blue candles.


First, we need to determine how many sets of 5 red candles there are in the 45 red candles Avianna bought. We do this by dividing the total number of red candles by the number of red candles per set:


45 red candles ÷ 5 red candles/set = 9 sets


Now that we know there are 9 sets, we can find out how many blue candles there are by multiplying the number of sets by the number of blue candles per set:


9 sets × 3 blue candles/set = 27 blue candles


Final Answer: Avianna had 27 blue candles.

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of pounds of cheese Tony bought as 'x'.


The total cost of the cheese is $7 per pound, so the cost of the cheese is 7x dollars. The cost of the beef is $5 per pound, and Tony buys 1 pound of beef, so the cost of the beef is 5 dollars.


Tony starts with $87 and has $61 left after buying the beef and cheese. So, the total amount spent on beef and cheese is $87 - $61 = $26.


Now we can set up the equation:


7x (cost of cheese) + 5 (cost of beef) = $26


Solving for x:

After the first night:
Final number of vampires = 2 + (2 * 5) = 2 + 10 = 12

After the second night:
Final number of vampires = 12 + (12 * 5) = 12 + 60 = 72

Raw response:  Final Answer: Daisy and Rose have 2 dogs.

To solve the problem, we can use the equation 4x + 4y = 24, where x is the number of dogs Daisy has and y is the number of dogs Rose has.

First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4:

x + y = 6

Now, we can see that the total number of dogs is 6. Since Daisy and Rose are the only two people in the pool, they must have the same number of dogs. Therefore, Daisy and Rose each have 3 dogs.

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the trip. Let's denote the cost of an adult ticket as A and the cost of a child ticket as C.

We know that:

5A + 2C = 76 (total cost of the trip)
C = 7 (cost of a child ticket)

We can substitute the value of C into the first equation:

5A + 2(7) = 76

Now, we can solve for A:

5A + 14 = 76
5A = 62
A = 12.40

Final Answer: The cost of an adult ticket is $12.40.

Raw response:  Teacher: That's a good start, Jordy. However, you need to consider the weight of the rocks as well. Let's correct that.

First, let's find the total weight difference between Jack and Anna:

Total weight difference = Jack's weight - Anna's weight
Total weight difference = 60 pounds - 40 pounds
Total weight difference = 20 pounds

Now, let's find out how many 4-pound rocks are needed to make up this difference:

Number of rocks = Total weight difference / Weight of each rock
Number of rocks = 20 pounds / 4 pounds per rock
Number of rocks = 5 rocks

Final Answer: Jordy, you need 5 rocks to make the weights equal on the see-saw.

2. The big toenails take up twice as much space as the regular toenails.
3. She has already placed 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails in the jar.

First, let's find out how many regular toenails would fit in the space taken up by the big toenails:

20 big toenails take up the space of 20 * 2 = 40 regular toenails.

Now, let's find out how many regular toenails can fit in the remaining space:

Total toenails that can fit in the jar = 100
Toenails already in the jar (big and regular) = 20 + 40 = 60

2. Since each member gets to pick a book once a year, we can assume that each person will pick a book 1 time.
3. To find out how many times Ron gets to pick a book, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people in Ron's couple: 10 people / 2 people in Ron's couple = 5.
4. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can multiply the number of times Ron gets to pick a book by the number of weeks in a year: 5 times a year * 52 weeks = 26

36 = 2 * (J + 6)

Now, we can solve for J:

36 = 2J + 12
24 = 2J
J = 12

So, James is currently 12 years old. Since James' older brother is 4 years older than James, his older brother is:

B = J + 4
B = 12 + 4
B = 16

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Frank has spent in all the mazes and then determine how much time he can spend in the current maze to keep his average time below 60 minutes.

Frank has already spent 45 minutes in the current maze. He has completed 4 other mazes, and the average time spent in those mazes is 50 minutes.

Total time spent in 4 mazes = 4 mazes * 50 minutes/maze = 200 minutes

Total time spent in all 5 mazes = 200 minutes (from previous mazes) + 45 minutes (current maze) = 245 minutes

To find the maximum time Frank can spend in the current maze while keeping the average time below 60 minutes, we can set up the following equation:

Raw response:  To find the number of sales in the stationery section, we first need to determine the fraction of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections.

Fabric section: 1/3 of sales
Jewelry section: 1/4 of sales

To find the fraction of sales in the stationery section, we subtract the sum of the fractions of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections from 1:

Fraction of sales in stationery section = 1 - (1/3 + 1/4)

To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12:

Fraction of sales in stationery section = 1 - (4/12 + 3/12)
Fraction of sales in stationery section = 1 - 7/12
Fraction of sales in stationery section = 5/12

First, we know that 40% of the students are learning from home. This means that 60% of the students are in school.

Now, we need to find the percent of students in each of the two equal groups. Since there are two groups, we divide the 60% by 2, which gives us 30%.

Finally, we need to find the percent of students in school on any given day. Since there are two groups, and only one group is in school on any given day, we divide the 30% by 2, which gives us 15%.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: 15% of students are present in school on any given day.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Erin counts six trolls hiding by the path in the forest.
2. She counts 6 less than four times the number of trolls hiding under the bridge.
3. She counts half as many trolls hiding in the plains as under the bridge.

Let's denote the number of trolls hiding under the bridge as \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of trolls hiding under the bridge is four times the number of trolls hiding by the path, minus 6. So we can write this as:
\[ x = 4 \times 6 - 6 \]
\[ x = 24 - 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Now, we know that the number of trolls hiding in the plains is half

Now, we know that Jaco has a $100 budget and he has already spent $72 on his friends' gifts. To find out how much he has left for his mother and father's gifts, we subtract the amount spent on friends' gifts from the total budget:

$100 - $72 = $28

Since Jaco wants to buy gifts for his mother and father that are of the same amount, we can divide the remaining budget by 2:

Number of bottles needed = 20 weeks * 4 times/week = 80 times

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the car wash soap by multiplying the number of bottles needed by the cost of each bottle:

Total cost = 80 times * $4.00/bottle = $320.00

So, Jake will spend $320.00

4 + 7x - 4 = 11 - 4

This simplifies to:

7x = 7

Now, we can divide both sides by 7 to solve for x:

7x / 7 = 7 / 7

This gives us:

x = 1

Now that we know Devin taught Algebra for 1 year, we can calculate the number of years he taught Statistics:

Statistics = 5 * x

Statistics = 5 * 1

Statistics = 5

Finally, we can calculate the total number of years Devin taught:

Total years = Calculus + Algebra + Statistics

Total years = 4 + 1 + 5

To find the total storage space of the second floor, we need to solve for x:

Then, a tropical storm washed away half of the sand, leaving 4 feet of sand. Finally, a tsunami added 2 feet of new sand, making the total amount of sand 6 feet.


Since it took Pirate Rick 4 hours to dig through 8 feet of sand, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it would take him to dig through 6 feet of sand:


8 feet / 4 hours = 6 feet / x hours

Raw response:  To find the total loan amount, we need to calculate the total amount Sarah will pay over the 5 years and then subtract the down payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount paid in 5 years.
Sarah will make 60 monthly payments of $600 each.
Total amount paid = 60 payments * $600 per payment = $36,000

Step 2: Subtract the down payment from the total amount paid.
Total loan amount = Total amount paid - Down payment
Total loan amount = $36,000 - $10,000 = $26,000

Final Answer: Sarah's loan was for $26,000 (including the down payment).

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students in Ms. Jones' class. We know that 30% of the class gave her thank you cards, and 1/3 of these cards contained a gift card for $10. We also know that she received $50 in gift cards.

Let's denote the total number of students in the class as x.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who gave thank you cards.
Number of thank you cards = 30% of x = 0.3x

Step 2: Calculate the number of thank you cards that contained a gift card.
Number of thank you cards with a gift card = 1/3 of 0.3x = (1/3) * 0.3x = 0.1x

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of gift cards received.

Jenny's current property tax rate is 2% x $400,000 = $8,000 per year. The city's new high-speed rail project will increase her house's value by 25%, making it worth $500,000. The new property tax rate will be 2% x $500,000 = $10,000 per year. Jenny can afford to spend $15,000 - $8,000 = $7,000 per year on property tax. To find out how much she can spend on improvements, we divide the amount she can afford to spend on property tax by the property tax rate: $7,000 / 2% = $350,000.

4 days * 1 episode per day = 4 episodes

2. Calculate the total length of the show Max watches from Monday to Thursday:

4 episodes * 30 minutes per episode = 120 minutes

3. Convert the total minutes to hours:

120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the doves.
2. Determine the number of eggs that hatched.
3. Add the number of hatched eggs to the original number of doves to find the total number of doves.

Step 1: Each dove laid 3 eggs, and there were 20 doves. So, the total number of eggs laid is:
20 doves * 3 eggs/dove = 60 eggs

Step 2: 3/4 of the eggs hatched. To find out how many eggs hatched, we multiply the total number of eggs by 3/4:
60 eggs * 3/4 = 45 eggs hatched

Raw response:  Teacher: That's a good start, Alejandra. However, we need to consider that Jeffrey takes 2 steps backward for every 3 steps forward. So, for every 3 steps forward, he actually only makes 1 step towards the mailbox. To cover a distance of 66 steps, Jeffrey needs to take 66 x 3 = 198 steps. Therefore, the final answer is: Jeffrey takes a total of 198 steps when he goes from the house to the mailbox.

Raw response:  To find the total number of tablespoons of popcorn kernels needed, we can set up a proportion. We know that 2 tablespoons of popcorn kernels make 4 cups of popcorn. So, we can write the proportion as:

2 tablespoons / 4 cups = x tablespoons / 13 cups

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 tablespoons * 13 cups = 4 cups * x tablespoons

26 tablespoons = 4x

Now, we can divide both sides by 4:

26 tablespoons / 4 = x

x = 6.5 tablespoons

So, they will need 6.5 tablespoons of popcorn kernels.

Final Answer: 6.5 tablespoons

To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of each snail and then use that information to find the time it took for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk.

Step 1: Determine the speed of each snail.
The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.
The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail, so its speed is 2 * 2 = 4 feet per minute.
The third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail, so its speed is 4 * 5 = 20 feet per minute.

Step 2: Calculate the distance of the sidewalk.
Since the first snail took 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, we can use its speed to find the distance.
Distance = Speed * Time

Raw response:  Final Answer: The two people would have to work for 5 hours to solve the same problem.

Explanation:
If one person takes 10 hours to solve the problem, then the total amount of work required to solve the problem is 10 person-hours. If a second person is added who is equally good at math, the total amount of work remains the same, but it is now shared between two people. Therefore, each person would need to do 10/2 = 5 person-hours of work. Since each person is working for 5 hours, the two of them would have to work for 5 + 5 = 10 hours to solve the same problem.

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the loss for each dozen donuts and then determine how many dozen donuts Javier needs to buy and sell to reach his goal.

Step 1: Calculate the loss for each dozen donuts.
Loss per dozen = Cost per dozen - Selling price per donut * 12
Loss per dozen = $2.40 - $1 * 12
Loss per dozen = $2.40 - $12
Loss per dozen = -$9.60

Step 2: Calculate the number of dozen donuts needed to reach the goal.
Number of dozen donuts = Goal amount / (Selling price per donut * 12)
Number of dozen donuts = $96 / ($1 * 12)
Number of dozen donuts = $96 / $12

Let's break down the information given:

1. Devin taught Calculus for 4 years.
2. He taught Algebra for twice as many years as Calculus, so Algebra = 2 * 4 = 8 years.
3. He taught Statistics for 5 times as long as Algebra, so Statistics = 5 * 8 = 40 years.

Now, let's add up the number of years he taught each course:

Total years taught = Calculus + Algebra + Statistics
Total years taught = 4 + 8 + 40
Total years taught = 52 years

Final Answer: Devin has taught for 52 years.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pages Juan reads in an hour.


Given:

- Juan takes 4 hours to move from his office to grab lunch.

- The time he takes to read a book is twice the time he takes to move to grab lunch.

- The book has 4000 pages.


First, we find the time Juan takes to read the book:

Time to read the book = 2 * Time to move to grab lunch

Time to read the book = 2 * 4 hours

Time to read the book = 8 hours


Now, we calculate the number of pages Juan reads in an hour:

Pages read per hour = Total pages / Time to read the book

Pages read per hour = 4000 pages / 8 hours

Pages read per hour = 50

But the cap at the bottom of the tub is not very airtight and lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the tub in minutes?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net amount of water added to the tub in one minute. In one minute, the tap adds 12 liters of water, but the cap lets 1 liter of water escape. Therefore, the net amount of water added to the tub in one minute is 12 - 1 = 11 liters.

Raw response:  To find out how many years Aziz's parents had been living in America before he was born, we need to subtract the number of years between 1982 and 1985 from the total number of years they had been living in America.

Step 1: Calculate the number of years between 1982 and 1985.
1985 - 1982 = 3 years

Step 2: Subtract the number of years between 1982 and 1985 from the total number of years his parents had been living in America.
39 years - 3 years = 36 years

Final Answer: Aziz's parents had been living in America for 36 years before Aziz was born.

Raw response:  Mariana: Yes, that's correct! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Karina is currently 40 years old.
2. Karina is twice as old as her brother, so her brother is 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. To find the year Karina's brother was born, we subtract his age from the current year: 2021 - 20 = 2001.
4. Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 2001.

Final Answer: Karina's brother was born in 2001.

Raw response:  Teacher: That's a good start, Alejandra. Let's go through the steps together. First, you correctly calculated that the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs. However, when you subtracted 18 from 40, you didn't consider that 40 guests showed up. Let's correct that.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hotdogs prepared for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each.
36 hotdogs = 18 guests * 2 hotdogs per guest

Step 2: Calculate the number of hotdogs needed for the remaining guests to have one hotdog each.
40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests
22 hotdogs = 22 guests * 1 hotdog per guest

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hotdogs needed for all guests.

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as "f". According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.


The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and in the second aquarium is 32. The difference between these two numbers is 32 - 4 = 28.


The equation based on the problem statement is:

28 = 2f


To find the value of "f", we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

28 / 2 = 2f / 2

14 = f


Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.


Final Answer: There are

2. Seashells:
Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

3. Magnets:
Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each.
Cost of magnets = 4 * $0.25 = $1

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $6 + $1.50 + $1 = $8.50

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils.

Step 1: Find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have.
Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils.
Meg has 46 pencils.

Total number of pencils = Jam's pencils + Meg's pencils
Total number of pencils = 26 + 46
Total number of pencils = 72

Step 2: Find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils.
We know that each box can hold 24 pencils.

Number of boxes needed = Total number of pencils / Pencils per box
Number of boxes needed = 72 / 24

Raw response:  Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people. Each sandwich serves 4 people, so he needs to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese in total. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so he will spend 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00 on meat. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so he will spend 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00 on cheese. Therefore, Tyson will spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20

To find out how many times people can jump in the pool before Jim has to clean it, we need to calculate the amount of water that can be lost before the pool reaches 80% of its capacity.


First, we convert the pool's capacity from liters to milliliters because the amount of water lost per jump is given in milliliters.


2000 L = 2000 * 1000 ml = 2,000,000 ml


Next, we calculate 80% of the pool's capacity:


80% of 2,000,000 ml = 0.80 * 2,000,000 ml = 1,600,000 ml


Now, we subtract the amount of water that can be lost

However, she was only able to do 19 situps on Tuesday. To find out how many situps Shawna would have to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we need to calculate the total number of situps she has done so far and subtract it from her goal.

Total situps done so far = 12 (Monday) + 19 (Tuesday) = 31 situps

To meet her minimum goal, Shawna needs to do 30 situps. Since she has already done 31 situps, she has already exceeded her goal by 1 situp.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in all rows. There are four rows with six desks each, and each row is 2/3 full. So, the number of students in each row is 6 x 2/3 = 4. Therefore, the total number of students in all rows is 4 x 4 = 16.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the previous hay and the better quality hay separately, and then find the difference between the two costs.

1. Calculate the total cost of the previous hay:
Number of bales = 10
Cost per bale = $15
Total cost = Number of bales * Cost per bale
Total cost = 10 * $15
Total cost = $150

2. Calculate the total cost of the better quality hay:
Number of bales = 20 (double the previous amount)
Cost per bale = $18
Total cost = Number of bales * Cost per bale
Total cost = 20 * $18
Total cost = $360

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Tabitha has been adding new colors to her hair. We know that she started this tradition when she was 15 years old, and she will have 8 different colors in her hair in three years.

Let's denote the number of years Tabitha has been adding new colors to her hair as 'x'. Since she started at 15 and will have 8 colors in three years, we can set up the following equation:

15 + x + 3 = 8

Now, let's solve for 'x':

15 + x + 3 = 8
x + 18 = 8
x = 8 - 18
x = -10

Since the number of years cannot be negative, we can conclude that there is an error in the student's answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem

2. Samuel cleared 223 dust particles, so there were 331 - 223 = 108 dust particles left on the porch.
3. Since Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, we can set up the equation: 9/10 * x = 108, where x is the total number of dust particles before Samuel swept.
4. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10/9: x = (108 * 10) / 9 = 120.
5. Therefore, there were 120 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swe

He is amused by letting the water run for 1 minute, then closing the water supply for 1 minute, and so on alternating opening and closing the water supply. But the cap at the bottom of the tub is not very airtight and lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the tub in minutes?

To solve this problem, we need to consider the net amount of water added to the tub per minute. The tap adds 12 liters of water per minute, but the leak lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. Therefore, the net amount of water added to the tub per minute is 12 - 1 = 11 liters.

100 = πr^2
r^2 = 100/π
r = √(100/π)

Step 2: Set up the equation for the perimeter of the square.
Perimeter of square = 4s

Step 3: Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the area of the circle, we have:

Raw response:  Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps. On Monday, Shawna was only able to do 12 situps, so she decided that she would make up for the rest on Tuesday. However, she was only able to do 19 situps on Tuesday. To find out how many situps Shawna would have to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of situps Shawna needs to do to meet her goal: 30 situps.
2. Subtract the number of situps Shawna did on Monday from her goal: 30 - 12 = 18 situps.
3. Add the number of situps Shawna did on Tuesday to the remaining situps: 18 + 19 = 37 situ

Raw response:  Winnie: I started by figuring out that 60% of the students are paying for their lunch. So I took 60% of 50 students, which is 30 students. Then, I took the total cost of $210 and divided it by the number of students, which is 50. That gave me the cost of feeding one student, which is $4.2. I then multiplied $4.2 by the number of students paying for their lunch, which is 30, and got the total cost of $126. So, the paying students pay $4.2 for their lunch.
Final Answer: The paying students pay $4.2 for their lunch.

Step 1: Let x represent the length of the second segment.
Step 2: The first segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined, so it is 6x.
Step 3: The third segment is half as long as the second, so it is x.
Step 4: The entire show is the sum of the three segments, so it is 6x + x + x = 8x.
Step 5: We know that the third segment is 10 minutes long, so x = 10.
Step 6: Substitute x = 10 into the expression for the entire show: 8x = 8(10) = 80.

Final Answer: The entire show is 80 minutes long.

Number of batches = 3

First, we find the number of cookies in a batch:

Number of cookies in a batch = Total chocolate chips / Chips per cookie
Number of cookies in a batch = 81 / 9
Number of cookies in a batch = 9

Now, we divide the number of cookies in a batch by the number of batches:

Number of cookies in a batch = 9 / 3
Number of cookies in a batch = 3

Raw response:  To find the profit made by Star Wars, we need to subtract the cost of making Star Wars from the total amount earned. So, the profit made by Star Wars is 200 million - 25 million = 175 million.

Now, we know that the profit made by Star Wars is half of what The Lion King made. So, we can set up the equation:

Profit made by Star Wars = 1/2 * Profit made by The Lion King

175 million = 1/2 * 10 million

To solve for the profit made by The Lion King, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

175 million * 2 = 10 million

350 million = 10 million

Now, we can solve for the profit made by Star Wars:

Profit made by Star Wars = 350 million

Step 2: Calculate the number of feathers that can be safely plucked from one flamingo.

After 3 months, the number of plants doubles once more, so there are 2 * 4x = 8x plants.

Now, Mark digs up 4 plants and gives them to his friend, so the remaining number of plants is 8x - 4.

According to the problem, Mark still has 20 plants, so we can set up the equation:

Explanation:
Let's denote the amount of money Nigel gave away as x.

Nigel started with $45, gave away x dollars, and then received $80 from his mother.

After receiving the money from his mother, Nigel has $45 - x + $80 = $125 - x.

According to the problem, Nigel now has $10 more than twice the amount he originally had, which is $90.

So, we can set up the equation:

Raw response:  To find out how much Geoff spent on sneakers over the three days, we need to calculate the amount he spent each day and then add them together.

Monday: Geoff spent $60 in total.

Tuesday: Geoff spent 4 times as much as he did on Monday, so 4 * $60 = $240.

Wednesday: Geoff spent 5 times as much as he did on Monday, so 5 * $60 = $300.

Now, we add the amounts spent on each day:

$60 (Monday) + $240 (Tuesday) + $300 (Wednesday) = $600.

Final Answer: Geoff will spend a total of $600 on sneakers over the three days.

1. Jim buys the first ring for $10,000.
2. He buys the second ring for twice the price of the first ring, which is 2 * $10,000 = $20,000.
3. He sells the first ring for half its value, which is $10,000 / 2 = $5,000.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent and the amount received from selling the first ring:

Total spent = Cost of first ring + Cost of second ring
Total spent = $10,000 + $20,000
Total spent = $30,000

Raw response:  To find out how much Alice has to pay for the certification out of pocket, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost since her insurance covers 90% of it.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the certification.
Total cost of certification = $3000

Step 2: Calculate the amount covered by insurance.
Amount covered by insurance = 90% of $3000
Amount covered by insurance = 0.9 * $3000
Amount covered by insurance = $2700

Step 3: Calculate the amount Alice has to pay out of pocket.
Amount Alice has to pay out of pocket = Total cost of certification - Amount covered by insurance
Amount Alice has to pay out of pocket = $3000 - $2700

Raw response:  Step 2x $8 is derived from the equation 2x + $15 = $23. I subtracted $15 from both sides of the equation to get 2x = $8. This is because if the cost of a large puzzle is $15 and the cost of a large and small puzzle together is $23, then the cost of a small puzzle must be $8.

To find the cost of 1 large and 3 small puzzles, we can use the equation:

Cost of 1 large puzzle + Cost of 3 small puzzles = Total cost
$15 + 3($8) = Total cost
$15 + $24 = Total cost
$39 = Total cost

Final Answer: You would pay $39 for 1 large and 3 small puzzles.

Raw response:  To find the current cost of the lawnmower, we need to determine the fraction of the current cost that is not the 2/5 reduction. Since the total cost a year ago was 2/5 times less than the current cost, the remaining fraction of the current cost is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.


Current cost = 3/5 * 1800

Current cost = 1080


Now, to find the total cost for 4 lawnmowers, we multiply the current cost by 4:

Total cost for 4 lawnmowers = 4 * 1080

Total cost for 4 lawnmowers = 4320


Final Answer: Mr. Lucian would need to pay $4320 to buy 4 lawnmowers.

Raw response:  Let's denote Pam's current age as P and Rena's current age as R.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Pam is currently twice as young as Rena: P = R/2
2. In 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam: R + 10 = P + 10 + 5

Now, let's solve the system of equations:

From the first equation, we can express R in terms of P: R = 2P

Substitute this expression for R into the second equation:

2P + 10 = P + 10 + 5

Simplify the equation:

P = 5

So, Pam is currently 5 years old.

Final Answer: Pam is currently 5 years old.

Raw response:  To find the cost of the computer, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C.

We know that the TV costs $600, and the fridge costs $500 more than the computer. So, the cost of the fridge is C + $500.

The total budget is $1600, and the TV costs $600. So, the remaining budget after buying the TV is $1600 - $600 = $1000.

Now, we can set up the equation:

C (cost of the computer) + (C + $500) (cost of the fridge) + $600 (cost of the TV) = $1000

Combining the terms, we get:

2C + $1100 = $

2. She dropped a tray of eggs, and 3 eggs broke. So, there are 24 - 3 = 21 eggs left.
3. Twice as many eggs cracked as broke, which means 3 * 2 = 6 eggs cracked.
4. Now, we need to find the difference between the eggs that are still in perfect condition and those that are cracked.

There are 21 - 6 = 15 eggs that are still in perfect condition.

To find the number of students who identified chess or basketball as their favorite sport, we need to add the number of students who like basketball (40% of 250) and the number of students who like chess (10% of 250).

Number of students who like basketball = 40% of 250 = 0.4 * 250 = 100 students
Number of students who like chess = 10% of 250 = 0.1 * 250 = 25 students

Total number of students who like chess or basketball = 100 + 25 = 125 students.

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the length and width of the lake and then use the formula for the area of a square to calculate the area.

Step 1: Find the length of the lake
The boat travels at a speed of 10 MPH and takes 2 hours to go across the length of the lake.
Length = Speed × Time
Length = 10 MPH × 2 hours
Length = 20 miles

Step 2: Find the width of the lake
The boat travels at a speed of 10 MPH and takes 30 minutes to go across the width of the lake.
Width = Speed × Time
Width = 10 MPH × (30 minutes / 60 minutes)
Width = 10 MPH × 0.5 hours
Width = 5 miles

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much sand Pirate Rick has to dig through to reach the treasure.

2. The tropical storm washed away half of the sand, so there were 8/2 = 4 feet of sand left.
3. The tsunami added 2 feet of new sand, so there were 4+2 = 6 feet of sand on top of the treasure.
4. Therefore, Pirate Rick has to dig through 6+8 = 14 feet of sand to reach the treasure.

Since it took him 4 hours to dig up 8 feet of sand, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it took him to dig up 14 feet of sand:

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the total distance traveled around the ring. Let's call the distance traveled after the 3rd turn "x".

We know that the car travels 5 meters after the 1st turn, 8 meters after the 2nd turn, and x meters after the 3rd turn. After the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel.

So, the total distance traveled around the ring is:

5 + 8 + x + 0 = 23

Now, we can solve for x:

13 + x = 23
x = 23 - 13
x = 10

Final Answer: The car had to travel 10 meters after the 3rd turn.

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the distances Alex and Max have run at each stage of the race.

1. Alex and Max are even with each other for 200 feet.
2. Alex gets ahead of Max by 300 feet.
3. Max gets ahead of Alex by 170 feet.
4. Alex gets ahead of Max by 440 feet.

Now, let's calculate the distances they have run at each stage:

1. Alex and Max have run 200 feet.
2. Alex has run 200 + 300 = 500 feet.
3. Max has run 200 + 170 = 370 feet.
4. Alex has run 200 + 300 + 440 = 940 feet.

Raw response:  To find out how many dozen donuts Javier needs to buy and sell to reach his goal, we need to calculate the profit per dozen and then determine how many dozens he needs to sell to make $96.

Step 1: Calculate the profit per dozen
Profit per dozen = Selling price per donut * Number of donuts in a dozen
Profit per dozen = $1 * 12
Profit per dozen = $12

Step 2: Calculate the number of dozens needed to reach the goal
Number of dozens needed = Goal / Profit per dozen
Number of dozens needed = $96 / $12
Number of dozens needed = 8

Final Answer: Javier needs to buy and sell 8 dozen donuts to reach his goal of $96.

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of watermelons sold. Let's denote the number of customers who bought two watermelons as x.

We know that:
- 17 customers bought one melon
- 3 customers bought three melons
- x customers bought two melons

The total number of watermelons sold is 46.

So, the equation can be written as:
17 + 3(3) + 2x = 46

Now, let's solve for x:
17 + 9 + 2x = 46
26 + 2x = 46
2x = 46 - 26
2x = 20
x = 10

Final Answer: 10 customers bought two watermelons.

Raw response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money each person has and then add them together.

1. We know that Patricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro. So, Jethro has $60 / 3 = $20.
2. Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has. So, twice the amount of money Jethro has is 2 x $20 = $40.
3. Since Carmen needs $7 more to have $40, she currently has $40 - $7 = $33.

Now, we can find the sum of all their money:

Patricia: $60
Jethro: $20
Carmen: $33

Total = $60 + $20 + $33 = $113

Raw response:  I see what you're trying to do, but let's take a step back. We know that the cost of the boots and the cost of the two pairs of high heels combined is $5 more than the cost of just the boots. So, if we subtract $5 from the total cost of the two pairs of high heels, which is $99, then we get the cost of the boots, which is $94.

Raw response:  Let x be the original price of the book.

The discount is 25% of the original price, so the discount amount is 0.25x.

The price after the discount is the original price minus the discount amount, so we have:

x - 0.25x = $19.50

Combining like terms, we get:

0.75x = $19.50

To find the original price, we divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75

x = $26

Raw response:  First, we need to find the sum of Brinley's scores on the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

To have an average of 93 after six tests, the sum of all six scores should be 93 * 6 = 558.

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores from the desired sum: 558 - 438 = 120.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93. Final answer: 120

Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is R+2.
The total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3R, and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(R+2).
The total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42, so we can write the equation: 3R + 5(R+2) = 42.
Simplifying the equation, we get: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

So, the small pool now has x - 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons of water.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M+10) + (M+10) = 2M + 20.
Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can set up the equation 2M + 20 = 20.
Solving for M, we get M = 0.
Therefore, Mico and Marco's ages are both 0.

So, 6x + 9 = 3(x + 9).
Expanding the equation, we get 6x + 9 = 3x + 27.
Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get 3x + 9 = 27.
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3x = 18.

Raw response:  Let's assume the number of students in each of the two equal groups is x.
The smallest group has 10 less students than each of the other groups, so it has x-10 students.
The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can write the equation: 2x + (x-10) = 200.
Combining like terms, we get 3x - 10 = 200.
Adding 10 to both sides, we get 3x = 210.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 70.
Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

3/5x = 12.8

To solve for x, we need to isolate x by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3.

x = 12.8 * (5/3)

x = 21.3333

Since we are dealing with land, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number.

x ≈ 21

Mr. Ruther had approximately 21 hectares of land at first. Final answer: 21

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time for the triathlon is 150+10 = 160 minutes.
To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike time from his total time: 160-101 = 59 minutes.

Raw response:  First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 MPH, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * (30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour)
Distance = 32 * (1/2)
Distance = 16 miles

Next, we need to find out how many bails of hay Michael needs to buy. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, we can calculate the number of bails as follows:

Bails = Distance * (1/2)
Bails = 16 * (1/2)
Bails = 8 bails

Now, we need to find out how much the 8 bails of hay cost. Since each bale costs $3, we can calculate the

Raw response:  Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P.

If you buy the super ticket, you pay $20 and get one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost is $20 + $1 = $21.

If you don't buy the super ticket, you pay $12 for the movie ticket and the regular price of popcorn plus the regular price of the soda. So, the total cost is $12 + P + $3.

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the total cost of the super ticket and the regular items is $21 - $2 = $19.

Therefore, we have the equation:

$12 + P + $3 = $19

Solving for P:

P = $19 - $12 - $3

Three-fourths of students have a desktop computer, so (3/4)x students have desktop computers.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

(4/3)(1 - 3/4)x = (4/3)(20)

(4/3)(1/4)x = 80/3

x = (80/3) * (4/3)

Since the cost of food for each person at the first venue is $5, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the two costs equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now, we solve for x:

Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x = $2. Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2. Final answer: $2

Raw response:  Let's assume the cost of the lot is x dollars.
The cost of the house is 3x dollars.
The total cost of the house and lot is x + 3x = 4x dollars.
We know that the total cost is $120,000.
So, 4x = $120,000.
To find the cost of the house, we need to solve for x.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.
Therefore, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.
Final answer: The house cost $90,000.

So, James made a profit of $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500 per car.
He sold 10 cars, so his total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.
He gets a 10% commission on the profits, so he made $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500 in commission.
Final answer: James made $17,500 in commission.

Raw response:  Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's assume the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G.

We know that:
1. S + G = 20 (total number of animal heads)
2. 4S + 2G = 70 (total number of animal legs)

We can solve this system of equations to find the number of sheep.

From equation 1, we can express G in terms of S: G = 20 - S

Now, substitute this expression for G in equation 2:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
2S = 30
S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm. Final answer: 15

Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, so the length of the extended dress is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

She also added 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim, so the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20cm.

We know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

Raw response:  Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, so 40% of 80% is used for industrial purposes. 

40% of 80% = (40/100) * (80/100) = 32/100 = 0.32

Therefore, 0.32 or 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes. 

To find the percent of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage from the total usage: 

100% - 32% = 68%

So, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. Final answer: 68

Raw response:  Let's assume the number of cases needed for the second house is x.
The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so it needs (1/2)x cases.
The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(1/2)x = x cases.
The total number of cases needed for all three houses is x + (1/2)x + x = 2.5x.
We know that the total number of cases needed is 250, so 2.5x = 250.
Dividing both sides by 2.5, we get x = 100.
Therefore, the third house will need x = 100 cases of shingles. Final answer: 100

Raw response:  Let's assume PJ has x cards. 
Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards. 
The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: x + 3x + 12 = 341. 
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 12 = 341. 
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 4x = 329. 
Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 82.25. 
Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number, so PJ has 82 cards. 
Smendrick has 3 * 82 = 24

2) x = z + 2 (You are two years older than your sister)
3) Mom's age = 3y - 1 (Mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)
4) x + y + z + (3y - 1) = 87 (The sum of all your ages is 87)

In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.
So, the total number of times she mowed lawns is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.
If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, then the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * $6 = $54x.
Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $54x.
To find the value of x, we need to know the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.
Without that information, we cannot determine the exact amount she made from lemonade sales.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we have the equation J + (J-10) + (2J-10) = 100.
Combining like terms, we get 4J - 20 = 100.

According to the given information, we have the following equations:

1) S = 2L (Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones)
2) 3S = L (Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals)
3) 4S = 120 (Teresa earned $120 from the sales of small stuffed animals)

From equation 3, we can find the value of S:

S = 120 / 4
S = 30

Now, we can substitute the value of S into equation 1 to find the value of L:

Raw response:  Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, so for 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter. 

The grocery store has a promotion where you can buy one pound of butter and get another half off. So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 4 pounds at full price and get 2 pounds at half price. 

The full price of 4 pounds of butter is 4 * $4.00 = $16.00. 

The half price of 2 pounds of butter is 2 * ($4.00/2) = $4.00. 

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $16.00 + $4.00 = $20.00.

The total amount of fence they have is x + (x+60) = 100 feet.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence, and Harry gets 20+60 = 80 feet of fence.

The total amount of fence they have is 20+80 = 100 feet.

To find the number of parts in total, we add the parts for men and women: 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

To find the number of passengers per part, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts: 84 / 14 = 6 passengers per part.

Since there are 9 parts for women, the number of women on the bus is 9 * 6 = 54 women.

Raw response:  Tom's restaurant makes 6 reservations a night, so they make 6*2 = 12 reservations a week. They order 2 meals per reservation, so they order 12*2 = 24 meals a week. Each meal costs $5, so they make 24*$5 = $120 from meals a week. They also order a $5 bottle of wine per reservation, so they make 12*$5 = $60 from wine a week. In total, they make $120 + $60 = $180 a week. Final answer: $180

Raw response:  Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Let's assume there are x chickens and y cows. We can set up the following system of equations: x + y = 20 (total number of animals) and 2x + 4y = 70 (total number of legs). Solving this system of equations, we find that x = 10 and y = 10. Therefore, there are 10 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm. Final answer: 10

Raw response:  I see what you're trying to do, but let's take a step back. We know that the cost of the boots is $99, and the cost of the two pairs of high heels combined is $5 more than the cost of the boots. So, we can set up an equation: 

Boots + Heels = Boots + $5

Now, we know that one pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, so the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Now, we can substitute the values into the equation:

$99 + $99 = $99 + $5

Simplifying, we get:

$198 = $104

This means that the cost of the boots is $104.

Since we know the length is 3 yards, we can convert it to feet by multiplying by 3 ft/yd, which gives us 9 ft. Then, we can add the width of 120 ft to the length of 9 ft, which gives us 129 ft. Finally, we can double that to get the perimeter of the room, which is 258 ft.

Raw response:  How many miles can Dana travel in six hours? How much faster is Dana's running speed compared to her walking speed?
Parsed prediction:  ["How many miles can Dana travel in six hours? How much faster is Dana's running speed compared to her walking speed?"]
Label:  How fast can Dana run? ** If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
How fast can Dana walk? ** And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
How many hours does Dana walk? ** If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
How many hours does Dana run? ** If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
How many miles does Dana run? ** Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
How many miles does Dana walk? ** She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
How many miles does Dana travel? ** Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
